<p class="patch_title" id="2012v001"><b>Omega 003 -> 2012</b></p>
<p><strong>The Inferno rework</strong></p>

<p>Similar to Inferno difficulty in Diablo 3, the last difficulty is now the 'bonus difficulty' for maxed characters, instead of a stepping stone on your way to uberquests. This means it is much harder than before, but you can find sacred uniques and sets there now! The regular game, from level 1 to 120, is now compressed in only two difficulty levels, eliminating redundant redundancy and limiting the boredom of going through the whole godforsaken game 3 times before you can start farming.</p>

<p>Destruction difficulty:<br />
- The hidden monster level 121 no longer exists, sacred uniques and sets drop off level 120 monsters as well.<br />
- Every monster in Destruction is level 120.<br />
- Monsters with a health multiplier below 300% were scaled up so the difference to 300% health is halved (for instance, a 100-120% Cursed Soul now has 200-210%, but a 285-370% Tenebral still has 285-370%).</p>

<p>Terror difficulty:<br />
- Rescaled monster levels from 50 to 115, up from 50 to 90.<br />
- Increased Terror base monster stats.</p>

<p>Experience gain:<br />
- Increased in Terror difficulty.<br />
- Greatly reduced experience gain past character level 115.</p>

<p>General:<br />
- Monsters no longer move faster on higher difficulty levels.<br />
- Increased uberlevel monster health scaling to at least 1000% for most uberquests.</p>

<p><strong>The cold damage rework</strong></p>

<p>- Monster cold length is no longer reduced by difficulty level.<br />
- Every monster can now be chilled.<br />
- Cold chill now only slows by 20% against monsters.<br />
- Skill-based cold duration greatly increased.<br />
- Monsters now have a 25/50/75% chance to be immune to freeze.</p>

<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>

<p>- Reduced walk and run speed by 10%.<br />
- Changed barbarian, necromancer and sorceress select quote.<br />
- Corrected the listed damage on all weapon skills with added magic damage (thanks rad82).<br />
- Innate abilities now have a full description.<br />
- Minions now scale with clvl/2 instead of clvl*2 to prevent health overflow.<br />
- Reduced base block rates by 1% for all classes.</p>

<p><em>Amazon</em></p>

<p>- Wild and Free: reduced movement speed bonus by 5% at all levels.<br />
- Defensive Harmony: no longer slows enemies that swing at you and miss.</p>

<p>- Wyrmshot: submissiles are now fire arrows instead of fire swords (?!).</p>

<p>- Pounce: uses a different way to calculate flat damage to prevent overflow at high stat/skill levels.</p>

<p>- Moonbeam: fixed graphic.</p>

<p>- Blood Elementals: corrected damage display.</p>

<p><em>Assassin</em></p>

<p>- Storm Crows: corrected damage description (you were hoping for a buff right?) xD<br />
- Maelstrom MkIV: developed in secret to skirt the ban on fragmentation weapons, the 'Scylla' upgrade features flechettes magnetically coated in monomolecular flecks of metal stripped from the user's weapons, which seems to trigger the wapons' magical enchantments on impact. This technology rendered the projectile too bulky to pierce through enemies, but with this design requirement out of the way, space was found for a heavier fuel-air warhead to deal with immune targets, giving the wielder two effective forms of attack.</p>

<p>- Batstrike: corrected bat familiar damage display.<br />
- Barrier Strike: base crit chance is now 5% as displayed, not 0%; increased blade duration to 2.4 seconds.<br />
- Twin Fang Strike: removed annoying sound effect.</p>

<p>- Limpet Laser replaces Cryo Beam: sticky grenade that is thrown against a wall and fires cryo beams at nearby enemies.</p>

<p>- Way of the Phoenix: reduced base damage to 15-20 from 20-35.<br />
- Way of the Gryphon: reduced base damage to 1-40 from 1-50.</p>

<p>- Blink: correctly displays stun length again.<br />
- Perfect Being: reduced EHP% per level from 6-5-4-3-2 to 5-4-3-2-2.</p>

<p>- Bionetic Blast: now causes knockback (1/3) instead of stagger; increased aoe radius by 20%.<br />
- Psionis Storm: increased radius; targets close to the middle are now staggered.<br />
- Beacon: doubled fire damage and massively increased physical damage.</p>

<p><em>Barbarian</em></p>

<p>- Corrected minion life display (looks like a big nerf, but it's just the skill display matching up with actual life now) (*)</p>

<p>- Titan Strike: now starts at 10% armor instead of 0%.</p>

<p>- Snake Stance: slow target caps at 35%, down from 50%.<br />
- Bear Stance: reduced armor to 10% per level, down from 15%.</p>

<p>- Wolf Companion: Doom radius is no longer bugged; no longer die to reflected damage; halved Doom damage.<br />
- Fortress: increased timer to 7-3 seconds from 5-2 seconds, increased rate of fire from 15 frames to 10 frames.</p>

<p>- Shamanic Trance: reduced life bonus due to overflow.</p>

<p>(*) Thanks rad82. May be off by 2 life because I'm too lazy to do it properly. Hard math is hard.</p>

<p><em>Druid</em></p>

<p>- Blindside: now costs 0 mana.<br />
- Cascade: halved mana cost.<br />
- Elfin Arrows: increased base DS from 5% to 15%.<br />

<p><em>Necromancer</em></p>

<p>- Voodoo Shot (renamed from Widowmaker) now gains +1 missile per soft point; added a graphic to indicate origin area.</p>

<p>- Summon Shadows: reduced Demon Blood elemental damage bonus from 7% per level to 4%.</p>

<p>- Rathma's Chosen: now has 1/8 chance to play a new sound.<br />
- Graveyard: new cast sound.</p>

<p>- Frostclaw Totem:  increased collision size (preventing misses)<br />
- Fireheart Totem: doubled rate of fire, reduced targets from 4 to 2, increased splash damage radius.</p>

<p><em>Paladin</em></p>

<p>- Plague is now the holy uberskill, and Resurrect is now the neutral uberskill.</p>

<p>- Retaliate: now has only 66% chance to knockback, down from 100%.<br />
- Merkabah: replaced sound effects (thanks Arthandas).<br />
- Colosseum: replaced sound effects (thanks Arthandas); no longer requires a melee weapon.</p>

<p>Morninglord rework:<br />
- New skill: Sunstorm (replaces Glittering Regalia): channel to shoot a stream of glowing bolts at the nearest enemy, doing tons of damage.<br />
- Brimstone: now a delayed detonation instead of a trap.<br />
- Ring of Light, Brimstone and Rising Dawn now grant you the 'Resonance' buff (+50% total defense and 1/2 energy added to strength) if you are in a specific spot to absorb the spell's energy.<br />
>>> Resonance bonus to Searing Glow: +3 second dazzle duration.<br />

- Snow Queen: increased life bonus cap from 25% to 30%.</p>

- Miasma: slightly reduced damage and attack rating penalties to enemies.</p>

<p><em>Other skills</em></p>

<p>- Fixed erroneous scaling of a number of non-learnable summoning skills.<br />
- Fixed the damage and attack rating display of a number of non-learnable summoning skills (not a stat nerf).</p>

<p>- New skill: Shunpo (assassin naginata oskill): essentially a Pounce clone with reduced AoE and no timer.</p>

<p>- Claw Tornado: ND reduced to 4, now deals 3/4 damage and always shoots 5 tornadoes.<br />
- Dark Summoning: has a 10 second cooldown again. Stop cheesing!<br />
- Detonate: now always deals 5K physical damage to the target; it is no longer dependent on energy.<br />
- Fear Bomb Totem: no longer gains an undocumented HP bonus from Stormeye Totem.<br />
- Hammertime: all sources of this now always produce 10 hammers.<br />
- MIRV: now correctly uses Beacon scaling.<br />
- Pandemonium: added Fallen Sarandesh and Mahasattva to the monster pool.<br />

<p><strong>The Slow change</strong></p>

<p>The Slow Target modifier on (most) off-weapon items and socketables is now Slow Melee Target, which slows your target on attack. If you have a source of regular slow, the regular slow will overwrite it as soon as the attack actually lands. If you do not, your direct target is now severely slowed.</p>

<p>Fixed issue that caused the slow modifier to spawn both slow and melee slow.</p>

<p>This impacts existing items as following (only includes items where the slow was changed and nothing else, otherwise see the items section of the changelog):</p>

<p><em>Items that were changed to Slow Melee Target</em></p>

<p>* Runewords:<br />
- Snowsquall</p>

<p>* Uniques (existing instances get a required level of 555 and become unusable):<br />
- Grimspirit<br />
- Oreichalcos<br />
- The Gauntlet<br />
- Xepera Xeper Xeperu</p>

<p>* Crafts:<br />
- Slow crafted jewels</p>

<p><em>Items that automatically update</em><br />
No action is necessary.</p>

<p>* Runewords (containing Zod):<br />
- Gharaniq: 5% slow -> 5% melee slow.</p>

<p>* Socketables:<br />
- Zod runes: 5% slow -> 5% melee slow.</p>

<p><em>Items that were not changed</em></p>

<p>* Every weapon unless mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<p>* Runewords:<br />
- Amaymon</p>

<p>* Uniques:<br />
- Deadman's Hand<br />
- The Sightless Eye</p>

<p>* Sets:<br />
- Full set: Caoi Dulra.<br />
- Full set: Cinadide's Craft.</p>

<p><em>Slow removed entirely</em><br />
See below under the 'items' section because this is technically an item rebalance, not a slow modification.</p>

<p><strong>Items</strong></p>

<p>- Changed the random reanimate pool.<br />
This affix requires a monstats range. New monsters are added to the end of the file, and moving lines is dangerous or impossible because regular reanimate modifiers and monster spawner missiles require a monstats ID.

<p><em>Uberquests</em></p>

<p>- Normalised chance of physical immunity: common monsters on uberlevels CAN randomly be physical immune (exception: Fauztinville, where they already have immunities). Bosses, as well as common monsters in summoning/dungeon ubers CANNOT randomly be physical immune.<br />
- Uberquests with un-shield novas (Akarat, Khalimgrad) now have the primary target set to 200% resist all, which causes the -1000% resist nova to drop them to 0% resists, up from the silly -50% they had before.</p>

- New ubermonster: Sunless Reveler (Island of the Sunless Sea): tough cleric who casts Wraithverge bolts.<br />

- Energy bonus display on spells now correctly counts strength factor as well.<br />
- 'Slow' is now dispelled when the monster is struck by an attack.<br />
- Reworded many spell descriptions of abilities based on base stats, replacing the 'per 100 [stat]' with 'percent of [stat]'.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon</strong></p>

<p>- Bloodlust: description is now more verbose.</p>

- Dragonlore (renamed from Trinity): increased self-synergy from 10% to 15%.<br />
- Wyrmshot (renamed from Dragonforce): reduced attack rate from 1 shot every 12 frames to 1 shot every 13 frames (not less damage, but more spacing between shots, extending range but potentially reducing concentrated dps).</p>

- Ricochet: increased base number of hits from 3 to 5; increased range; reduced mana cost; +2 targets per skill level, up from +1.<br />
- Moon Queen: reduced IAS bonus; added deadly strike bonus based on hard points; life per kill is now soft point based.<br />
- Fairy Ring: added 1 second timer.</p>

<p>- Magic Missiles: reduced cast sound volume; removed bounce sound; missiles per level is now linear.<br />
- Balefire: corrected bug that caused the afterflames to deal 1/4 damage (whoops); increased mana cost; afterflame duration reduced at low levels, but now increases with level.<br />
- Bloodstorm: reduced missile speed; duration now matches description (+0.2 seconds per level down from +0.4); damage slightly increased; seek range no longer increases with level, increasing accuracy against nearby targets.</p>

The RPS-8 'Maelstrom MkIII' rocket-propelled flechette dispenser has a bigger blast radius on a direct hit and submissile damage is now based on the user's dexterity, preventing on-striking procs from going off in unintended directions and causing collateral damage. To compensate for the loss of damage, the flechettes are now fired in a spiral trajectory for improved short range coverage.<br />
- Broadside: improved graphics by adding a device that shoots the knives.</p>

<p>- Perfect Being: rebalanced avoidance %: now it gives +10% 'effective HP' (ie. damage to death) +6% to +2% per level at a linear rate. Even though the avoidance percentage slows down as it approaches 100%, you continue getting 6-2% survivability for every point.</p>

<p>- Pummel: increased area of effect.<br />
- Wildfire: damage now based on strength instead of energy.<br />
- Circle of Life: increased self-synergy from 15% to 25% and improved heal ramp.</p>

<p>- Trap Rat Form: increased defense from 5% per level to 10% per level.<br />
- Quill Storm: reduced missile count to 15 per target, but increased damage to 2/3 weapon damage and added flat magic damage.<br />
- Egg Trap: reduced damage from 3/4 to 3/5, but reduced delay between spike novas to ensure more hits on individual targets.<br />
- Thorn Wall: wall pieces now break down when touched, but deal 1/2 damage up from 1/4.</p>

<p>- Widowmaker: now lasts 0.8 seconds and fires 24 arrows, but now also adds a +base weapon damage bonus (experimental). This spell was balanced, so I regret having to do this, but the 'trap' effect (the emitter stays in place) was stupid.</p>

<p>- To improve discoverability and simplify the cube recipes, there are 7 new consumable reagents ('oils') and 3 new reusable reagents ('catalysts') which can be bought for cheap at your local armor vendor. The corresponding recipes have been modified:<br />
Dupe recipe (item + Oil of Duplication + arcane crystal)<br />
Unsocket recipe (item + Oil of Disjunction; if nonmagical, you still need 3 perfect gems)<br />
Quality upgrade recipe (several, see docs)<br />
Chaos reroll recipe (item + Oil of Luck + jewel)<br />
Lucky upgrade recipe (item + Oil of Luck)<br />
Jewelcrafting (jewel + Oil of Jewelcrafting + appropriate rune)<br />
Respec (Oil of Absolution + rune)</p>

<p>Disenchant recipe (unique/set item + Catalyst of Disenchantment)<br />
Signet recipe (unique/set item + Catalyst of Learning)<br />
Affix burn recipe (item + Catalyst of Destruction + rune)</p>

<p>- Expanded the disenchant and signet recipes:<br />
Disenchant recipe: can now also disenchant set items for 1 shard.<br />
Signet recipe: reduced to 1 signet (due to Dat Bug), but can now also disenchant unique items for 1 signet.</p>

<p>- Dupe recipe: can now dupe every wearable item, however it will add a +5 required level penalty to both duped items if the items are not jewels. Also, it cannot dupe already duped items, again if the items are not jewels.<br />
- Unique uptier recipe: now requires a rune instead of a gem.<br />
- Zomghelp recipe: now requires a magic amulet and ring instead of a rare one.</p>

<p>- I Am Rich recipe: now requires three precious trophies, but the resulting gem now causes you to emit a red halo that is visible to you and most importantly everyone else. Earlier versions of this item now say 'Poser!'.</p>

<p><strong>Sets</strong></p>

<p>- Big Game Hunter set: now 15% chance to reanimate Ulfhedinn instead of Asathorr.<br />
- Celestia's set: +% poison spell damage now fixed at 50%.<br />
- Cinadide's set: oskill Golden Calf now fixed at level 24.<br />
- Pantheon set: increased damage to +250-500.<br />
- Vasily's set: increased oskill Death Shards level from 9 to 29.<br />
- Warmage set: oskill Summon Jinn level now fixed at 30 to prevent the random twitching issue.</p>

<p><strong>Runewords</strong></p>

<p>- Lag fixes:<br />
Demhe: 50% level 33 Plague Avatar -> 25% level 50.<br />
Manitou: 50% level 51 Elemental -> 25% level 60.</p>

<p><strong>Uniques</strong></p>

<p>- Hwanin's Hwacha: proc now works again.<br />
- Katamari: replaced +1 max minions with +5% minion life.<br />
- Lag fixes, at least those that were reported you lazy slimes:<br />
Salamander's Breath: Rune of Fire proc reduced to 5-30%.<br />
Scales of the Serpent: 25% Time Strike -> 20%; 15% Carpet of Spiders -> 25%.<br />
Snowhammer: 50% level 41 Ice Whirl -> 25% level 60 Ice Whirl.<br />
Talon of Trang-Oul: reanimate chance: 10%.</p>

<p><strong>Drop rates</strong></p>

<p>- The HMC is now dropped by Hatred Baal.</p>

<p><em>Make it rain!</em><br />
- Class-specific items now have a 2/3 drop chance, up from 1/3.<br />
- Increased the rune pool at low levels (Act 1-2 Hatred).<br />
- Increased the rune pool dropped by Act bosses.<br />
- Reduced the chance to cascade down the TCs for armor and weapon items.<br />
= Monsters are more likely to drop items at their level instead of lower end items. At low levels the difference is small, but it grows at high levels; after level 90 you will see 40% more 'high end' items and correspondingly fewer 'low end' items. Areas that already have a sacred item bias are not affected.</p>

<p>- To reduce clutter, removed drops from the minions of:<br />
Akarat<br />
Tal Rasha<br />
Koth<br />
Jitan<br />
Bartuc<br />
Inarius (summoning)<br />
- Drop rates are less affected by /players x in order to mitigate the 'carpet of items' effect in crowded areas; the reduced number of items should be mitigated by the drop cascade reduction, so you 'should' get about the same number of sacred items at p8.<br />
- Slightly increased unique, rare and set drop rates.</p>

<p>- Reduced gold drop rates in Island of the Sunless Sea at lower difficulty levels.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mercs</span></p>

<p>- Act 1 Priestess: now uses Pagan Rites instead of Sacred Armor.<br />

<p>- Improved monster damage curve at lower difficulty levels (0-33% damage increase depending on level).</p>

<p>- Mephisto: now uses Lightning Arena instead of Nova Charge.<br />
- Akarat: fixed a bug where his Hammertime was erroneously multiplied, causing massive damage and framerate loss.<br />
- Azmodan: halved monster density in his dungeon.</p>

<p>- Landmass: increased hp.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Misc</span></p>

<p>- Dark Summoning timer reduced to 3 seconds.</p>

Near the end of each Act in Terror and Destruction difficulty, you may randomly find a group of special monsters. Kill them in Terror and they will drop exactly one token. Cube all tokens with your class charm to get a bonus.</p>

<p>- <strong>Slayer Challenge</strong><br />
Kill Act bosses in Terror or Destruction. They will drop a token in addition to their regular drop. Cube all tokens, but include one of the Prime Evil tokens 3 times (eg. Andariel, Duriel, Mephisto/Mephisto/Mephisto, Diablo, Baal) to</p>

<p>get a Signet of Skill.</p>

<p>- <strong>Level Challenge 2</strong><br />
Simply kill Primus (Rathma Square) in Terror difficulty and cube your class charm with a perfect gem for a bonus. Also, you need to do this before level 90.</p>

<p>- To make the Black Road Challenge (BRC) viable in Terror difficulty, King Koth, Tran Athulua and Fauztinville are now level 80 in Terror, down from 90-105. Additionally, Tran Athulua and Fauztinville monsters have the same stat% in Terror as in Hatred instead of boosted stats.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minigames</span><br />
Newly introduced in 1.E9, these are a collection of 'tasks' that result in a max skill level bonus.</p>

<p>- <strong>Witch Blood</strong><br />
Find the Countess in Terror difficulty. Kill her and cube your charm with an Eth rune (r05) for a bonus. By the way... the Countess dungeon's inhabitants are a <em>bit</em> unusual this time round.</p>

<p>- <strong>Crowned</strong><br />
Witches appear in specific areas and do not want to be disturbed. If you come too close, you are in trouble. This minigame is active on Terror difficulty and requires you to find a witch in any Act except Act 1. (This will<br />
not work on Act 1 witches). <em>SLOWLY</em> creep closer and see if a glowing star appears on your character. If so, cube your class charm with a Thul rune (r10). But be careful: too close and you're witch food.</p>

<p>- <strong>They Have Windows In Hell</strong><br />
In Act 4, you can find stained glass windows. Break one of these windows on Terror or Destruction difficulty and cube your class charm with a Hel rune (r15) while affected by the swirl effect to get a bonus.</p>

<p>- <strong>Mirror Mirror</strong><br />
In Act 5 Terror or Destruction difficulty, go to the final fight with Baal and kill his shardspawn minions. Only his minions!  An average of 250 kills later, you will get swirlies. Cube your class charm with a Lem rune (r20)<br />
for a bonus.</p>

<p><em>Amazon</em></p>

<p>- Dragonforce: range synergy now from Ghost Arrow; now gains +1 target per 2 levels to balance it against Barrage and Phalanx.<br />
- Spirit of Vengeance: detection range is <em>already</em> 80, and because I'm such a failure, I can't make it follow you either.</p>

<p><em>Assassin</em></p>

<p>- Perfect Being: bonus +5% at all levels.<br />
- Phase Bomb: resist pierce locked at -15%, enough to remove immunities but not enough to break uberquest shield auras.<br />
- Singularity: mana cost now 470.</p>

<p><em>Barbarian</em></p>

<p>- Eagle Stance: nerf reverted: heal bonus again based on soft points because I forgot people do not want to put more than 1 point into an active defensive skill unless it makes you invincible, and even then. This one only makes you half invincible.<br />
- Kraken Stance: corrected description.<br />
- Shower of Rocks: improved power of the attack rating curse.<br />
- Thundergod: reduced nova frequency to prevent permastun effect.<br />

<p><em>Assassin</em></p>

<p>- Singularity: corrected mana cost.</p>

<p><em>Barbarian</em></p>

<p>- Kraken Stance: implemented 2% synergy from any other stance.<br />

<p><em>Barbarian</em></p>

<p>- Kraken Stance: removed max level synergy because people don't get it, yay.<br />
- Spirit Guide: description is now correct.</p>

<p><em>Necromancer</em></p>

<p>- Soulshatter: removed ND again because zomg any skill with ND is useless, even if it has a ND of *2* and it was bugged to have no ND in the first place so it's like an omnidirectional Buckshot which means it is very overpowered but whatever, I don't care.</p>

<p><em>Barbarian</em></p>

<p>- Screaming Eagle: fixed description.<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters</span></p>

<p>- Base block modifier down to 0 for paladins, -1 for everyone else, -2 for sorcs.<br />
- Reduced mana per energy point by -1 (now you gain +2, +4 or +6) to reduce the chance of overflow with heavy investment.<br />
- Energy Factor power increased, but now tapers off at very high energy investments to prevent damage overflow.<br />
- The minion resistance cap is now +75%, up from 50% (and not 25%, liars).<br />
- Slightly reduced mana gain per energy point of some mana-intensive characters to avoid mana overflow.</p>

<p>- All enemy-affecting resist pierce skills (except the assassin uberskill Phase Bomb) have been removed, leaving only item-based sources of -% resist (including Shadowfiends). This is because due to a bug in D2, they worked at full strength against immunities based on shield auras, making a lot of uberquests trivial to beat. Sorry, people.</p>

<p><em>Amazon</em></p>

<p>- Death Ray: fixed too-long formula causing erroneously low damage.<br />
- Dragonstrike replaces Wraith Arrow: fires a slow moving dragon that shoots spines at nearby enemies.<br />
- Ghost Arrow: added self-synergy for +1 arrow per 10 levels.<br />
- Fairy Ring: fixed base target seek range; +0.6 yards at all levels.<br />
- Moon Warrior: increased enhanced damage bonus from 15% to 20% per level.<br />
- Pact of Blood: duration now goes up with hard points.</p>

<p><em>Assassin</em></p>

<p>- Doom: reduced synergy from 20% to 15%.<br />
- Perfect Being: now based on hard points, but you get run speed from soft points.<br />
- Rocket Blade replaces Maelstrom: fires a zigzagging explosive knife.<br />
- Scorpion Blade: now gains +1 blade per 10 Broadside levels; synergy moved to Rocket Blade.<br />
- Singularity: mana cost frozen at 780.<br />
- Way of the Spider: poison length now increases by 0.2 seconds per level.</p>

<p><em>Barbarian</em></p>

<p>- Eagle Stance: heal rate now based on hard points, and there is now a slight damage penalty.<br />
- Kraken Stance: added max level synergy from all other stances.<br />
- Lion Stance: corrected display showing excessive damage; reduced ED% component; removed max level synergy but increased magic damage per level.<br />
- Predator replaces Berserk Fury: similar effect, but instead of hit recovery speed it offers life steal.<br />
- Runemaster: reduced by half.<br />
- Screaming Eagle replaces Eagle Dive: similar effect, but instead of resist pierce it reduces damage and attack speed.<br />
- Shower of Rocks: now instead of the (bugged) physical resist pierce, it reduces enemy damage. This is because the proposed -% attack rating change was useless because you didn't bother doing the math or you did and concluded that -50% attack rating is slightly inferior to x2 defense so it's weak and gimped. Please abandon your melee barb. I want you to make a bombsin.<br />
- Snake Stance: slowing effect is now a self-synergy.<br />
- Spirit Guide: now also adds +40% total defense, +15% per hard point.</p>

<p><em>Necromancer</em></p>

<p>- Buckshot: QUAD RANGE.<br />
- Deathstrike: doubled flat damage component, which isn't bugged.<br />

- Necromantic Trance: added sound effect.<br />
- Summon Rampagor: poison damage now increases with character level, up to 5-10x higher than before!<br />
- Summon Void Archon: aura no longer reduces enemy resistance, but now reduces damage by 25%.</p>

<p><em>Paladin</em></p>

<p>- Edict of Forbiddance replaces Retribute: periodically deals weapon damage in an area.</p>

<p><em>Sorceress</em></p>

<p>- Bladestorm: increased damage from 1/2 to 3/4.<br />
- Hive: synergy increased from 8% to 10%.<br />
- Nova Charge: synergy increased from 4% to 6%.<br />
- Spiral Dance replaces Starfire. Sorry to all Starfire users. See above. Also, the melee sorc's reliance on a single unique item sucked.<br />
- Time Field: no longer has ND.</p>

<p><em>Others</em></p>

<p>- Added skills: Path of Flames, SMG, Amatoxin, BFG83K, Body of the Savior.</p>

<p>- Fixed bug where magic find did not work on set, rare AND unique items. Yes, MF% was entirely broken for months. It was a drama when the set bug was discovered, with people screaming for a patch and whatnot. Nobody noticed that uniques were broken in the same way. Thanks for participating in my unintended social experiment, and remember: *baaah! baaaaah!*<br />

- Astrogha: Venom Stinger: skill levels = 1.<br />
- Duncraig: poison throw damage greatly reduced to prevent instadeath against characters stuck in monster groups, making the level unfair for a lot of characters.<br />
- Tal Rasha &amp; Koth: minions now freeze immune because someone found a bug with this to stop shield auras and of course posted it in the public forum.<br />
- Toraja: by popular demand, now adds +1 max skill level, down from 5.<br />

- Vizjun: reward drop rate is now 100%.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Challenges</span></p>

<p>- Disabled the Attribute Challenges because people feel like they are REQUIRED to do them and then curl up and cry when it turns out they can't do them, cursing the gods of the world because their character will FOREVER be WEAKER.</p>

- Wyrd: removed sound; added timer floor of 0.2 seconds (sorry but there is
this idiotic engine bug where the timer disappears if it is below 3 frames, but
it still exists until it really hits 0 frames. This in turn causes people to
think 0 timer skills still lock out other skills even though they're not REALLY
0 timer skills yet).<br>

- Seismic Field: duration capped to prevent lag; fixed bug that caused reduced
number of hits (it had a NextDelay of 1 frame causing it to not hit when
