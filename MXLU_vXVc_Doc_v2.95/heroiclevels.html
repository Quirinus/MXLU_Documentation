		<p class="content">Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. Similar to ordinary demons but much stronger and more intelligent,
		heroic demons are more than a match for the toughest heroes.</p>

		<p><img class="highlight" src="images/highlights/heroic.gif" align="bottom" /></p>

		<p class="content">Median XL features four heroic areas:</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Act 1 Mausoleum (Burial Grounds)<br />
		Act 2 Stony Tomb Level 1 (Rocky Waste)<br />
		Act 5 Icy Cellar (Ancients&#39; Way)<br /></b> <i>Each of the three areas contains the same 20 heroic monster types. You may
		want to choose the area that suits your character build the most.</i></p>

		<p class="content"><b>Act 1 Cow Level (Rogue Encampment)</b><br />
		<i>Meet invisible cow ninjas, bovine summoners and other figments of your fever dreams after a bad case of food poisoning in
		the Cow Level!</i></p>
		<hr />

		<p class="genbig">HEROIC BOSSES</p>

		<p class="content">Each heroic area is protected by its own guardian and one appears only when its shrine is disturbed. The
		area&#39;s heroic boss may randomly appear in the area, or he may not... Beware, heroic bosses are among the hardest encounters
		in Median XL.</p>

		<p class="content">All heroic bosses are protected by an invulnerability shield. This shield is nearly impossible to break with
		mortal magic but will occasionally fail and drop a random immunity, though this still leaves the boss with high resistance to
		this element. Use these rare opportunities well.</p>

										The moolicious heir to the Cow King&#39;s throne, Bull Prince Rodeo is out to exact his indiscriminate revenge for all
										the cattle killed by humans.</p>

										<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
											Rodeo is very aggressive and has a stunning Hoof Stomp and the Blink spell, making it difficult to put some distance
											between you and him. He can also summon more cows or call upon a Stampeding Herd of exploding cows that ploughs across
											the screen, trampling all in their path. This ability is unblockable, unresistable and will destroy you if you don&#39;t
											get out of the way in time. But his most common spell, in cooperation with another victim of cruel farming practices, is
											a wave of chickens that will pursue their victim relentlessly, inflicting devastating hurt with their beaks if they
											connect. The chickens can be dodged by staying mobile. Being a sacred cow, Rodeo is invulnerable to damage. Warding
											shields are not an exact science, however, and the spell may occasionally fail, allowing you to hit him with one or more
											elements until the spell is restored.</p>

											<b class="content">NOTE</b>: Killing Rodeo does <b>not</b> prevent you from entering the Cow Level again.

					Stony Tomb Level 1 (Act 2: Rocky Waste)</p>

					<p class="content"><b>Lore</b><br />
					Hungry for power and misled by Diablo, the Vizjerei mage Quov Tsin almost succeeded in sacrificing the city of Ureh to
					the forces of Hell. He was defeated at the last moment, but his spirit still roams the burial tombs looking for a mortal
					vessel to come back to life...</p>

					<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
					As a former Vizjerei in life, Quov Tsin wields the elements. His most devastating attack is a streaming blast of fire,
					cold and lightning bolts powerful enough to annihilate any hero in a moment. In melee combat, he may use a fire, cold and
					lightning nova combo that causes massive destruction at close range. Prepare for this battle by equipping resistance
					items to counter his ability to pierce resistances, and try to find some absorb items to further cut the damage. His
					contingency spells protect him by teleporting him to safety when struck by any attack. Stay near cover in case he appears
					too close for comfort. Quov Tsin is protected by a mystical shield that makes him invulnerable to all damage, but
					thankfully for you, anger is not a good state of mind to maintain a difficult invulnerability spell. It may occasionally
					fail, leaving him vulnerable to one or more elements. Seize the moment.</p>

									<p class="content"><b>Lore</b><br />
										After his defeat in the civil war in Hell, the Lord of Lies and infernal King of Rats was banished to Sanctuary where he
										plots his return. The icy caves under Harrogath offered him both proximity to the powerful Worldstone and a dark moist
										breeding ground for his rodent servants.</p>

										<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
											As the Lord of Lies, Belial prefers to cheat in battle. His main offence consists of his Henchmen who use the Punisher
											spell to poison heroes to death. If one gets through this line of defence, his tiny rat familiars go on the attack. Being
											so small and fast, they cannot be hit or even aimed at. Belial himself wields a spell that spits out punishers in random
											directions, as well as an area effect spell that slowly siphons the victim&#39;s life away and the ability to summon more
											rats from the ground to swarm the unwary hero. According to witnesses, Belial does attack recklessly from time to time,
											chasing his enemy around by teleportation, but demonologists believe that this is just to impress his underlings and his
											main intention is to get close to summon another batch of Henchmen. Defensively, Belial is protected by a warding spell
											that makes him invulnerable to all attacks. Occasionally he may drop this shield for a few moments to entice a foolish
											hero to attack him; this is usually met with a fierce counterattack, but it is the only way to kill him.</p>

					<p class="content"><b>Lore</b><br />
					Athulua is the prime deity of the Amazon people. With her consort, Kethryes, she rules over the seasons and the weather.
					The Amazon capital, Tran Athulua, is named so in her honour. Athulua is responsible for some of the most mysterious
					powers in an Amazon&#39;s arsenal. When a warrior has proven her devotion to Athulua through her brave deeds and
					exceptional skill in battle, the Goddess shows her favour by granting a spiritual emissary to aid the Amazon. These
					emissaries of Athulua are called Valkyrie, and they are the spirits of the greatest heroes from the Amazon people. The
					power to summon a Valkyrie is the greatest honour that an Amazon warrior can receive. It is believed this gift is a sign
					that your place beside the Goddess is assured when you pass from this world-perhaps even as a Valkyrie.</p>

					<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
					You can find the Amazon Goddess at the heart of the ruins. Her bow attacks deal heavy physical damage - make sure to avoid her
					Tantrum ability up close and her stunning Guided Arrows or you will become trapped in her kill zone.
					<br />
					<br />She will summon killable rat minions, which chase you down and	cast Tremor on death. Kill them from a distance so as to not get hit by this spell, which reduces your life significantly.
					<br />
					<br />Her other	attack is Sky Siege. This teleports her to your location creating a large dust cloud, which deals heavy physical
					damage over time. Be sure to leave its area of effect as soon as you can.
					<br />
					<br /> The only way to damage	her is to attack her when her	powerful magical shielding aura weakens from time to time.</p>

					Astrogha does not usually fight his foes directly, but he does not need to. His summoned Spider Statues serve as gateways
					for his personal swarm, belching waves of crawling Darklings from the depths of the void. Deal with them quickly, but do
					not touch the statues! They are protected by one of Astrogha&#39;s devious tricks: when destroyed, they will both
					rejuvenate Astrogha and unleash a curse that cripples the assailant causing a swift death. If left alone, they will
					eventually collapse on their own. Astrogha also possesses a very powerful but close ranged Frozen Orb attack and has
					warding spells that teleport him away when damaged, courtesy of Quov Tsin&#39;s mages. Another dweomer copied from Quov
					Tsin during centuries of fighting side by side at the head of their respective legions is the warding spell that renders
					Astrogha immune to all attacks. This is cutting edge magic and therefore still fails from time to time, allowing you to

									<p class="content"><b>Lore</b><br />
										The Thief of Hope and the Banisher of Light is a demon lord summoned by a very powerful Vizjerei magi, long ago. He used
										his intelligence and power to form his cult and rule the lands. People followed his philosophy, &#39;walked&#39; the
										Black Road he created, and soon his power grew so much, that even the Prime Evils feared him, so they imprisoned him
										within the portal he came from, between the Sanctuary and the Burning Hells. It is whispered among his remaining
										followers that there is a way to release him from his centuries-long prison...</p>

										<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
											The Pillar of Skulls seals Kabraxis. It has a Heroic shield and fires Punishers when hit. Once you kill it, Kabraxis will
											be released. He has a heroic shield as well, and will pounce on you with various attacks, cast bone prison on you to trap
											you, summon his skeleton army of followers and cast broadside when hit.Your best hope is to keep running and killing the
											bone prison and skeletons as fast as you can, and not stand close to Kabraxis all the time.</p>

														<p class="content"><b>Elemental seals</b><br />
															If you&#39;re feeling like releasing more powerful beings, there are also 5 orb seals which used to seal Kabraxis once.
															Each seal is for one element: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Magic and Physical. When one is destroyed, it will unseal an Ultra
															Elemental, along with some normal elementals. The Ultra Elemental spawns new elementals, fires a powerful spell and takes
															damage only from it&#39;s own element - so be prepared to have a source of damage for every one of the elements. Once
															defeated, each Ultra Elemental will drop a Great Gem. Transmute all 5 Gems with the Kabraxis&#39; Soul to get additional
															bonuses.</p>
