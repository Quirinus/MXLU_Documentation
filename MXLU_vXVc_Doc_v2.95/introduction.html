			II Lord of Destruction. It modifies the game by replacing character	skills, improving items and monsters, and adding new uberquests. Originally created by Brother Laz and currently developed by MarcoNecroX.</p>
		<p class="gensmall">So is this a cheat?</p>
		<p class="content">Mods are not cheats. A cheat makes the game easier. Median XL: Ultimative turns Diablo 2 into
			an entirely new game.</p>

		<p class="gensmall">Features</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o New skill trees with 35 brand new skills per class.</b><br />
				Bored with Blessed Hammer? Median XL: Ultimative offers brand new
				skill trees. Each class has 30 main skills, 3 uberskills and 2
				challenge reward skills. If you ever wanted a crossbow necromancer
				or summoner amazon, here is your chance!</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o Improved monsters.</b><br />
				When was the last time a frog killed you? The monsters are
				much more aggressive and dangerous, and many have learned
				various new tricks. From quill rats with homing spikes to invisible
				templars, the monsters will pose a much tougher challenge.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o Elite and Heroic monsters.</b><br />
				If the normal monsters are tricky, the elites will have you run for
				your life. Featuring their own unique attacks and improved statistics,
				elite and heroic monsters are a match for the strongest heroes.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o 40 new uberquests for high level characters.</b><br />
				Forget Battle.net and 'Uber Tristram', Median XL: Ultimative has 28 more
				uberbosses and 12 special uberlevels for high level characters.
				Defeating them on the highest difficulty yields powerful unique
				charms.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o New base items. Six quality tiers.</b><br />
				Median XL: Ultimative features many new class-specific items. Additionally,
				item stats have been rebalanced and there are now six

				improved. Plentiful random sockets on items offer a powerful way
				to customise your items.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o Enhanced magic and rare items.</b><br />
				Between the improved affix pool and the addition of powerful
				new affixes including percentage based attribute bonuses, rares
				are a much improved game option.</p>

				Median XL: Ultimative features over 700 new uniques and 35 new sets. Many of the

				areas.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o An assortment of new runewords.</b><br />

				Median XL: Ultimative offers many powerful new cube recipes including a
				revolutionary crafting system.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o Honorific items.</b><br />

				make your very own uniques? Now you can.</p>
		<p class="content"><b>o Special challenges for expert players.</b><br />

				game to obtain a special reward.</p>
