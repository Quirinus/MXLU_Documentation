<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged poison attack. Spike Nova on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Back some time ago, these rats used to be the ones to blame when it came to plagues and diseases that crippled whole towns.<br />
Now that they&#8217;ve been possesed by evil, they&#8217;ve learnt to concentrate their poison in their fur, now spiky and pointy and, what&#8217;s worse, they&#8217;ve learnt to shoot it at their foe.<br />
Also they&#8217;ve been at the &#8220;Telekinesis for dummies&#8221; course organized by Bishibosh this summer and have learnt to use their minds to direct the &#8220;spines&#8221; in flight. That is bad.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> ?? Don&#8217;t tell me you need an strategy for Kill Rats or I will be forced to suicide you.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Spike Fiend</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged poison attack, spike nova on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Kill Rats go blue sometimes... cuz, they have feelings &#8216;n stuff, you know.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Needing an strategy for them will <strong>still</strong> get you shot, do not mention it, period.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Shoot giant targeting physical spines, scare off newcomers in the Den of Evil, cast a spike version of Barrage on death, followed by a short ranged Spike Nova.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The ones that decided that taking drugs would pay off better than working and training hard... Sadly for all those hard working Kill Rats, they were right.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They&#8217;re not as tough as they look, smack them as you would  smack anything else and move when they die to avoid the short ranged missiles.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fallen One</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> None, just walk and hit. Physical damage only.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Red and little, these demons come straight from hell! And will go back straight to hell if you look at them angrily!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Bah.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Vampire Firewall, resurrect Fallen Ones.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Basically a taller version of the common Fallen One, many believe them to be wiser and actually own some mystic powers. Wrong.<br />
A closer look at their staff shows the &#8220;Cast wall of fire&#8221; and &#8220;Resurrect lololol&#8221; buttons on it, which they randomly hit whenever they engage battle. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Hell, just kill them! Before the regular Fallen Ones, preferably.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Invader</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Typical physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Wrongly these mobs are considered a different kind than Fallen Ones. In fact they&#8217;re the same, but these ones wear too tight belts, hence the blue color.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span>...Sure.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Same ol&#8217; Fallen Shaman after a prank from his mobs. Yeah, you guessed right, it was a blue paint bucket hanging on the door.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Kill him, then kill the lil&#8217; ones.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Defiler</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Almost ignorable physical melee attack. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> They STILL are simple Fallen Ones. But of course I had to note them as different monsters because ZOMG tey r yallow! :D<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> *silence*... *metallic sound of a sword getting out of it&#8217;s sheath* Outta here. Now.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Defiler Shaman</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Super-resurrection-of-Defilers + Vampire Firewall for double whammy.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> In his memory the words Diablo himself spoke directly to him burn and empower him (Note that D. was just asking for a towel to clean his throne of brains and random fluids, but however).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Basic whack and smack tactics beg to be used here.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Scourge</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> But... did anyone actually expect them to learn to do <em>something</em>? Lol. Physical melee attack ftw.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Fallen Ones 4eva! These ones are the black sheeps of the family and... wait... that&#8217;s about it.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They do a laughable amount of damage, more or less  30% more that they did when they were red, like... 20 levels ago?</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Scourge Shaman</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Resurrect and... yeah! How did you know it was Vampire Firewall? O.o&#8217;?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Classics are never out of style. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> As always, the largest blade of grass is the first one to be cut by the lawn mower.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Quite powerful physical/lightning melee hit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Howl, howl, howl! Santa Claws was around and let a few zomgbuffs under the tree for these little demons.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Haha! They&#8217;re fast and fairly strong by the time you meet them, so this time instead of ignoring them and killing their shaman, I&#8217;d reccomend luring them away from him and killing them there, if you&#8217;re about to be melee locked by them (= bad) rush to a nearby corner, so that not all of them can hit you at the same time.</ul><br />
(Thanks to Sing_In_Silence for the lightning component on attack)</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Warforged Shaman</strong> </span>ELITE </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Death Shards (explodes a corpse unleashing a flurry of weapon damage spikes) and Maelstrom as regular attack. Both are physical.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> A shaman whose Super Staff of Resurrection/Casting broke in battle and had to think about some other way of surviving... realizing, to his amazement, that being a weapon user is <em>friggin&#8217;</em> insanely great.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The only thing that remains more or less the same is his moving speed, so pick his mobs up, lure them away so that he won&#8217;t Death Shard you with the corpses and then come back to <em>finish the job</em>. Defense helps, since he uses weapon based attacks.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Zombie</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Super slow, 18+ fpa, Zomgbie strike! Deals lousy damage and poisons for a little time.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Hmm... well, these undead are certainly the least impressive creation of Hell&#8217;s necromantic powers... guess everyone was a noob once.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> ...please.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Hungry Dead</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Biting your ear. Beware, it <em>physically</em> hurts.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> When they were dead they didn&#8217;t care about being hungry,  but recent change to undeath has shown them that eating heroes is the best way of... well... eating heroes.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They move a little faster than othe zombie type monsters, but they suck big time anyway.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bonegrinder</strong> </span>ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Noticeable poison damage attack, casts Spike Novas on attack. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The zombified body of an steroids-abuser athlete. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Getting melee locked with these guys is BAD, so be careful because they move pretty fast. <br />
The spike novas are tricky due to ND, though, if the missiles come from a little away (say five yards), the three/five missiles that will hit you will deal their full damage, on the other hand, getting hit by a full blast at close range will simply count as a single hit.</p>

<p>That said, range them or take them one by one unless you&#8217;re Superman (I&#8217;m exaggerating, you can suck and tank them in melee anyway, but in order to avoid mid/end game cripples, you shouldn&#8217;t get used to do that)</ul><br />
(Spike Nova note about ND slightly changed thanks to Sing_In_Silence)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Skeleton</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> None, just physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> How can you make a Zombie faster? Just take the flesh outta him! They&#8217;ve lost the immunity lightning their rubber like skin granted them, but gained fire instead for some obscure reason. Also an AI improve allows them to wield clubs now.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> No excuses, if you need an strategy for them, you fail :P</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Returned</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee phys. attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t ask him where he comes from, wherever it was he seems to have forgotten his brain there.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> WARNING! <span style="color: blue;"> These terribly strong mobs pose a major threat and will absolutely annihilate you if you let them hit you even once! </span></ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Corruptor</strong> </span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Poison attack, casts Cloudkill on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Well, with a name like &#8220;Corruptor&#8221; you can&#8217;t expect it to bring you cookies.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t let them melee lock you, really. It&#8217;s easy to avoid them but if they get lucky and lock you, their poisoning procs will cripple you in a quite short time.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Skeleton Archer</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical arrows.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Sacrificing almost all of their mobility, these stationary Skeletons have been prepared for ranged combat and can shoot up to one freaking arrow per minute!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Worship the Bonebreakers.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Returned Archer</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Simple physical ranged attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Haha! He has <em>returned</em>! And, despite his mobility still is close to zero, his arrows are sharper now.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Basically, they suck. &#8216;N suckahs die ez.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Corruptor Archer</strong> </span>ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning/poisoned ranged attack and casts Cloudkill on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> You see those shiny white bones? Are you wondering where all the rotten meat is? Think about it for a while, the arrows are <em>poisoned</em> now...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Be careful when sending your summoned mobs to fight them, due to their possible low def they will get hit a lot of times, meaning the poison clouds will appear more often. There&#8217;s no real problem with them for non summoners.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fiend</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic. Yu-Gi-Oh still hurts them, though..<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Unless you consider coward fleeing a skill, none, just lightning based attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> These mobs show an AI increase already, they do still attack, but if their HP drops lower than 1/3 of maximum, they will flee from you to a safe spot.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Hit until they flee, then pursue or range them.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Blink</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Teleport when struck, lightning attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The mutations on these monsters have gone too far to know what the hell they were before (NOT bats :P). Not like anybody cares, though.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Considered the most annoying mobs in whole Act I. These guys suck, yeah, but the fact that you have to pursue them all across the map to kill them is actually another of their tactics, several heroes have been slain by random mobs when trying to maniacally finish an already half dead Blink.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Frost Raptor</strong> </span>ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning melee attack, casts Lemures on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> These guys are giving you the cold shoulder.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Their real damage comes from Lemures, and if you don&#8217;t pay some attention you&#8217;ll get surrounded by 4-5 of them, which will cast a lot of lemures... which will turn you into a frozen dead potato. Focus on one at a time, so that it flees after a few hits and stays a distance, allowing you to deal with the remaining ones.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Protector</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Big and furry, these humanoid beings used to be friendly before the Three&#8217;s taint; the fact that hundreds of towns were mysteriously ravaged on full moon nights, when herds of Protectors were spotted close, is just coincidence.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They have slightly higher HP than other mobs on the zone, they&#8217;re still laughable however.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Sasquatch</strong> </span> <em>Warning: Do Not Feed.</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Same ol&#8217; melee physical onslaugth.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> These overgrown forest squirrels like smashing into the ground anything that gets in their sight.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Use the widely known tactic beta 47 against them and everything will go alright.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Steelfur Titan</strong></span> ELITE</span> <em>Carebear.</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Thumb of the Giant Bezerk Rampage Beast melee phys attack. Also they have a Might aura that raises the damage of the affected monsters.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Because nothing says &#8220;I love you&#8221; better than cuddly stuffed bear... or a giant, maniacally yelling living one!<br />
It needs not to be fed, by the way, just let it take a walk next to kindergartens twice a week...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> These guys hit very hard and also buff other mobs, meaning you have to take them outta the way asap. Lure them away from other monsters, then if you&#8217;re a melee character corner yourself so that not all of them can hit you, then do your melee stuff. For ranged characters the solution is obvious, run around shotting every now and then until they drop. <br />
Summoners have to rely on their mobs... or actually hope that the active skill they got &#8220;just in case&#8221; is useful, but don&#8217;t worry, Laz made a bunch of them important synergies for summoneds, so you&#8217;re likely to have them even if you&#8217;re a &#8220;purist&#8221;.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Nothing but stabbing you with phys. damage. No, this is not copy + paste. Note that they might melee stab you or range stab you.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Well, finally some opponent that manages to walk slightly fast and attack you as well, also, they do wield more than a type of weapon :O. Too bad they tend to AI lock when they get to you :lol:<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> me says: &#8220;Put those demonically possesed baeches on teh ground where they belong!&#8221;<br />
If you don&#8217;t know who &#8220;me&#8221; is you&#8217;re going to hell. Put in a good word.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged/melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Skilled on bow attacks, these maniacs like laughing and killing stuff from a distance. Unless they decide that burying a random sharp object in your eye is funnier.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple, click on them and hold until they die.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Genuine fake sins, buy now!11!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> As with all invisible enemies, AoE attacks and DoT are almost always the easiest option. Any other way will do against these wannabe Assasins, though.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> NOTHING! LOL.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical attack...Whaaa, I&#8217;m sick of saying that already! T_T.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> These ones have a pretty clear name, they hunt for flesh, YOUR flesh.<br />
<strong>Strategy:</strong> <span style="color: blue;">It would require a few maps and three or four generals with their respective batallions to plan a truly working strategy to kill these monsters, they&#8217;re just too strong, fleeing is very reccomended.</span> No, of course they didn&#8217;t bribe me!</ul></p>

<strong>Strategy:</strong> This is the &#8220;typical melee monster&#8221; and therefore you shall apply the beta 47 technique. Note that this kind&#8217;s AI locks when it reaches you TOO.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Blindside. Yeah, that arrow that stuns you and kills you and stuff (monster version doesn&#8217;t pierce, btw).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> There are simply no hotter Rogues than these ones.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They come in packs, just like any elite does, so before attempting to kill them, it&#8217;d be a good idea to move around a while and separate them. If you don&#8217;t, the chance they stunlock you to death is pretty high.<br />
Some decent defense and placing a lolminion so that it absorbs a hit or two when separating them might be enough for melee characters, casters might prefer to use either dumb firepower or high DoT. Just find a way of dealing damage while you keep moving that matches your gamestyle.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Stunning physical attack, uses Lightswarm too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The same maniacs who stabbed you with arrows can now stab you with spears! <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Beware of their speed and try to not get stunlocked (hint= move), as always, I suggest actually <em> looking</em> at the screen in order to know how things are going. If they&#8217;re too much for you, flee. Really, just TP home, heal fully and come back to kill one of them.</ul><br />

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Hits with physical damage, also casts Poison Flash on attack, as well as it opens wounds.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Ever wondered what happens to the Venomous Spirits sorceresses cast? After a while they start taking physical form, getting then possesed by evil and morphed into these wicked giant mosquitos.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Whack and smack. Be careful with P. Flash, though, it can be dangerous with some lack of resistances.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Flash on attack, Casts Venomous Spirit on striking, opens wounds, drains resistance, physical damage attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>He will, he will, shock you!</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You don&#8217;t want these guys too close, Flash hits 4 times and actually deals some decent damage, mostly because of the lack of resistances you have in early game. Range/Damage over Time is reccomended. Note that they also cast VS...but since it&#8217;s on attack and you already have to keep distances because of Flash, you should&#8217;ve have too much problem.</ul><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> No, he&#8217;s not a blue guy with an umbrella sticked in his head.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Avoid melee contact if you cannot stand large numbers of other mobs, or they might lock you, killing you then with the lightning procs.</ul><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Invisible or not, they have to get close to hit you, simply use shift to attack and hit them without targeting. Not rocket science.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Static Lance, a fast dicharge of lightning that explodes on electric bolts when it hits something. Invisiblity.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> 666 watts are indeed cool, but bills were killing the Three, therefore these mobs have been placed in dark places such as caves for the obvious reason of saving some candles.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Interesting low game enemies, what makes them dangerous isn&#8217;t the Static Lance itself, but the fact that you won&#8217;t see them unless they&#8217;re casting it and, therefore, killing them will take some time. <br />
Also there&#8217;s the fact that they come in pretty large numbers and don&#8217;t stand still in a place. AoE attacks and Damage over Time deals with them pretty well, though. Bring decent lightning resistances.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well... I would make a suggestion or two, but nah, think on your own :P</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The damage they deal is decent, but if you aren&#8217;t trying to tank melee mobs at the same time, you shouldn&#8217;t have any problem. Also they have a kinda higher HP than other monsters around them.</ul><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Your range-fu is longer than it&#8217;s range-fu. And if you have no range-fu nor fire resistances to stand the hits, dive in, hit a few times, dodge the BS, dive in again...</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;Abomination&#8221; doesn&#8217;t actually refer to his form (which is disgusting) but at his AI, also known as the <em>nev-r-lock</em>.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They will only attack you from distance, so if you actually walk to them and force them to get close to a wall where they can&#8217;t get away from you, they will just sit there looking silly. Be how it be, they&#8217;d suck even without the AI locks.<br />
However, don&#8217;t let a pack of them range you without cold resistance. Just in case ;).</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Nothing to worry about, they&#8217;ll flee from you if you get too close, but they&#8217;re not fast enough anyway. Basic smackage is adviced.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> These ones, as most casters, will flee from melee combat, exploit their lack of speed and wipe the floor with their bony asses.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Actually, there&#8217;s no real problem even if the max amount of them is attacking you at a time unless you utterly and absolutely suck, so then... next!</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The humblest of all demonic commanders, of course they still send their underlings to death and just stay back casting, but hey, they <em>hid</em> their titles of superiority to not make their minions feel unimportant.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> While they do have a quite good passive skill and a really good element (magic resist isn&#8217;t a common modifier) as main attack, they manage to suck veeeery badly. Noobs.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> His low leveled Gamma Field damage can be easily tanked with some poison resistances, Cold Beam is ignorable with -100% cold resits. As you can possibly guess, this won&#8217;t be a hard fight.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Despite they do look great and Death Blosson is pretty cool by itself, their damage output isn&#8217;t that good, in fact, they&#8217;re pretty much laughable unless you are playing a summonsorc.
