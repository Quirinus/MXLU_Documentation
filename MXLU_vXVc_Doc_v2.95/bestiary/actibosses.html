<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Prince Albrecht</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Archer Skeleton.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Den of Evil, aka &#8220;The Cave&#8221;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cold Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cold ranged attack, slows (by 50%) on striking, casts Glacial Nova on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Has a serious lack of self-steem. Really, and the fact most Amazons look away when prowling at him the first time they see him doesn&#8217;t exactly help. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> 10+ Archer Skeletons, wich shoot cold arrows and slow by 50% on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The only time you could have problems would be the first time you meet him, because you&#8217;ll have to deal with the freeze lenght. However, ranged characters with a minimum skill should be able of sniping them from a safe spot, on top, this is even easier if you have piercing attacks and so.<br />
Now let&#8217;s talk about melee... <br />
Well, since you&#8217;re not likely to have any decent way of tanking the arrows by now, try to kill them one by one. You can outheal the damage with your pots for a while, but it might happen that they&#8217;re still alive when you run out of them. No problem, just crawl away from them, TP home, heal and come back. Then slay the rest of them.<br />
The damage from Albretch&#8217;s Glacial Nova is noticeable... but unlikely to kill you, however. Unless you kill him in melee range with 3 hp left, of course. If you do such a thing then prepare your soul for an icy death.</p>

<p>-In Terror and Destruction he&#8217;s piece of a cake. Mostly because you can afford a heavier use of health pots/TPs by then. Money rawrz.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, Concentration aura.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Bishibosh shouldn&#8217;t have used so many rejuvs...<br />
No, of course he didn&#8217;t really go back to his young version. He died because of an overdose and this guy replaced him.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> 10+ Fallen Ones, extra fast too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They&#8217;re just a bunch of fast Fallen Ones, you really shouldn&#8217;t have any problem. Just remember to kill any nearby shaman first, because if you don&#8217;t they&#8217;ll go on raising the extra fast minions over and over.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Grimspike</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Spike Fiend.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The Cave, level 1 (Cold Plains).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Targeting ranged poisoned/physical spikes, casts Spike Nova on death. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Used to have a calm life and just a few visits, mostly by noobish heroes who actually explore maps and don&#8217;t just rush from checkpoint to checkpoint... Then Duncraig came.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None. Likes to solo things, because that&#8217;s so much more win, y&#8217; know.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> There are very few things easier than killing a lonely rat, no matter if it&#8217;s a boss. However, if your defense and poison resistance are slightly below zero, you can move every now and then to avoid the spines, which by the way won&#8217;t hit you until they fly a few yards and target you.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Blood Raven</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Special Corrupt Rogue.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Burial Grounds, aka &#8220;Cemetery&#8221;, aka &#8220;Dead End&#8221;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical ranged attack, casts Nest, which calls a Zombie. Also casts &#8220;CluckcluckcluckImmagonnakillLaz AoE Lightning&#8221; on death (basically, it kills ANY (hostile or friendly) creature with the &#8220;Undead&#8221; tag it touches).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Kashya killed her. There are no facts, nothing we can use to prove it, of course. But we all know she did, it&#8217;s been obvious since the 90&#8217;s.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> No direct subordinates, the zombies she summons are just regular monsters.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> This won&#8217;t be a hard fight if you know how to handle it, but first of all, <strong>clean the surroundings</strong>. Belive me that if you jump in with a pack of mobs chasing you it&#8217;ll be harder. The same will happen if you&#8217;re spotted by random monster, possibly elites, when you&#8217;re chasing her over the place. <br />
If you&#8217;re a melee character, you should focus on her and ignore almost totally the Zombies. Keeping her targeted will make you follow her everywhere she tries to flee to, which will move you away from the ever increasing pack of Zombies.<br />
As a ranged character, you may have to get rid of the Zombies, mainly if you use directional non-piercing missiles/magicks. But anyway Zombies die easily and then you can focus your fire on her without problems, for any other random one she summons isn&#8217;t likely to be a decent meatshield by itself.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Targeting ranged poisoned/physical spikes, casts Spike Nova on death, weakens you on death/ striking (lowers physical resistance by 50%).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Said to be very closely related to the disappearance of all the goatmen in the Stony Field.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> 10~ regular Kill Rats<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> It&#8217;s a pack of static Kill Rats... I&#8217;m trying to keep B47 tactics away from the boss section, but seriously, B47.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Griswold</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Griswold. Yeah, he has his own class.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Tristam.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Stone Skin.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, curses on striking/death (lowers physical resistance by 50%).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> His mere existance seems to yell it out loud: &#8220;Not all pain is gain&#8221;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> He hits hard, that&#8217;s true, but he moves extremely slow and attacks slow too, so if you don&#8217;t let other random monster lock you, he should be easy prey.<br />
If you&#8217;re a melee character and have difficulties with him, simply ditch him and clean the area of other ranged attackers. Without them bothering you there should be no problem, since you can always outrun him in a pinch.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Wrathraven</span></strong></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong, Mana Burn.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning melee attack, teleports when struck.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Said to have Circle of Annoyance at slvl 80/100/120. That actually explains why <em>so many</em> heroes end up giving up and just pick the Scroll of Inifuss without killing him.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~10 Blinks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not a hard enemy, but indeed an annoying one. They&#8217;ll swarm you and force you to fight them just to fade away after being hit, making you chase them. Also, at low hp they&#8217;ll flee from you, making it twice hard to land a succesful blow in melee range. But what stops you from switching to a bow/crossbow and keeping them targeted to finish them? :P</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">The Countess</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Dark Stalker.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Tower Cellar Level 5.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Countess Firewall on the the doors when you go inside her room (theoretically to prevent you from fleeing, but the damage sucks).<br />
Also casts &#8220;I am Rich&#8221; on death, which simply opens the chest she was guarding. Another &#8220;skill&#8221; is that her look changes from game to game.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> A creature of legend, equally loved and hated all across Sanctuary.<br />
It&#8217;s true, a lot of people still hate her for that thing she had about killing vixens and bathing in their blood, but both the clerics who snatched her fortune and fought for it among themselves like vermins and those villagers she kidnapped in order to... umm... &#8220;satisfy&#8221; other needs, love her.<br />
Oh, also there was a guy who killed her and got six &#8220;Lo&#8221; runes. He started a fanclub right after regaining conscience: www.weheartdacountess.wee <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~7 Dark Stalkers, all of them Extra Fast. Note that their look will change randomly from game to game, matching the Countess&#8217; own. There&#8217;s a version which won&#8217;t attack out of the room, nor will follow you too far from it. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not really needed, she usually hits a bit harder than her minions, but it&#8217;s nothing to worry about. If you really can&#8217;t stand their attacks run out of the main room and kill her underlings away from her, she wont follow you. Then come back and fight her <em>mano a mano</em>.<br />
If you&#8217;re a worthless worm you can snipe her from behind the door with ranged attaks, but really, doing that is <strong>very</strong> lame. In fact if you do such a thing I&#8217;ll personally stalk you home and smack you. Nine times.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Drop Bias:</strong></span> The Countess has a very high chance to drop low/medium runes.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">The Smith</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Sith (Lol, I like that typo ;)), aka Overlord.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Barracks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Fire Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Heavy melee physical/fire attack. Casts Bloodlust on striking, curses on striking (-50% physical resistance). <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Spawned from the flesh of Andy&#8217;s personal incubus and closest general after she broke him, he&#8217;s said are said to use mental persuasion and moral dilemmas to make his enemies quake in fear. When that&#8217;s not an option, brute intimidation works pretty well, too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Nothing. Nobody wuvs him. T_T<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, this guy might be hard when you meet him.<br />
His hits are always somewhat strong, and he&#8217;ll buff himself/weaken you on striking, so his damage after cursing you and casting Bloodlust is likely to be 2x the first hit.</p>

<p>Another bad thing is his extreme speed (even without being Extra Fast), it will allow him to get to you and attack you almost constantly. Running of course is an option, but you really have to know what you&#8217;re doing to succeed that way.<br />
He&#8217;ll catch you every time you stop moving, so low defense characters will have to abuse potions since there&#8217;s no real way of avoiding the hits, lolsummons will get maimed almost instantly, so that&#8217;s not an option either way.</p>

<p>The way for melee characters is obvious, even though not neccesarily easy. He has a very decent AR, and can pack quite a punch whenever he makes it to hit you. Basically, you&#8217;ll need more def than usual to pass this gear check.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Moon Bender</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Blink.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Jail Level 2.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Lightning Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical/lightning attack, Teleports when struck and also casts Charged Bolts when struck.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Mighty being of ancient, adored as a deity by some amazonic tribes, who has known better times.<br />
He was the first of all lesser demons who rose against the High Heavens, for they had marked the human&#8217;s night sky with a straight line which gleamed white, silently showing the angelic contempt for demons.</p>

<p>This creature outraged as he knew of this, bashing any other demon in his way he tore the fabric of reality an entered the human world. <br />
Then, by altering space, matter and time, he converted the line into a sphere, which when looked from the Earth changed little by little, writing in an arcane runic language the following cryptic message: &#8220;Nyah-nyah, losers!&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~10 Blinks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not hard, yet as tedious as killing Wrathraven was. DoT however deals with them all very well. Remember that they might teleport to other rooms, so if one of them suddenly vanishes for good, checking the whole place could be interesting. Also they may teleport in a wall/outside of the map limits. If such a thing happens you might have to forget about them.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Blightfire</span></strong></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Cathedral.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong, Fire Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Pain Spirit, has passive Bacchanalia (adds damage based lost life) and Demon Blood aura (adds elemental spelldamage, boosts life and gives life regeneration).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> One of the two dreaded De-blight-ful duo. Their mischievous world domination plans and funny smell actually made them very popular among kids.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Nothing. He lost sight of his pal long time ago, and nothing can replace him. But drugs. And whores. And more drugs.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> His PS damage isn&#8217;t too outstanding, and however avoiding it is extremely easy. But he generates an aura which buffs enemies greatly, so before getting in his &#8220;personal space&#8221;, you should clear the place of any other monsters.<br />
Once he&#8217;s alone, go get him. It might take you a while to kill him due to his noticeable HP, but it won&#8217;t be too hard.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Andariel</span></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Act Boss</em></span> <br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Andariel.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Catacombs Level 4<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physicak attack. Casts Hive, casts Fire Fountain, Apocalypse and Meteor Shower.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Rightfully named as  Maiden of Anguish, this Sayan redhead demoness never doubted before using any of her woman weapons (such as the &#8220;how lonely I am&#8221; look, the lustful appearance, the sputter of neuro-toxic paralyzing acid...) to climb a little more in Hell&#8217;s scale. Also, in case you wonder about it, those spider like &#8220;arms&#8221; that come from her back are what her kind uses to cut her mate in pieces. You know, to make digestion easier and that.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None. Even though Acid Beasts seem to be linked to her.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Oh well... Before anything else, you should know that clearing fully the entrance and the beginning of her hall is a great help. If you don&#8217;t rush too far she won&#8217;t see you and you&#8217;ll be able of killing a half of her underlings, making your life much easier. Now you can just go a bit further so that she sees you and lure her away.<br />
Note that right after seeing you she&#8217;ll cast Hive, which will cast poisoned swarms if you get close. That&#8217;s why a large poison resistance will be a great help against her. Also she&#8217;ll cast fire spells. It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to see that fire resistance will help a lot too.</p>

<p>If for some reason you didn&#8217;t want to get fire resistance (I hope you did get poison), then you might find out, to your amazement, that her spells actually take some of your life away. She uses Apocalypse almost constantly, and there&#8217;s not way you can be in the same screen as her and avoid Apoc.<br />
Also she usually casts Fire Fountain, surrounding you with traps that damage you when you move from your &#8220;safe&#8221; spot and touch them. Avoid them when you see them flying, simply stop attacking and get out of the way before they hit you. <br />
Her Meteor Shower is the most rarely used one, and not really dangerous since there&#8217;s no reason for you to not move away from the impact zones and avoid the spectacular yet not too harmful meteors.</p>

<p>If you actually avoid her two avoidable spells and go all out in poison res, this fight shouldn&#8217;t be hard.</p>

<p>Of course, as a Summoner there&#8217;s little you can do to help changing the tide of the battle (other than resummoning and buffing them, duh), perhaps killing your monsters before luring her to an empty spot and then resummoning in town would be useful, though. (So that they don&#8217;t drag any other monster as well as Andy.)</ul></p>
