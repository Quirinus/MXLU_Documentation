<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Who said Flower skills only work with Assasin only weapons?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The physical damage itself might be a problem, but as well you sould be able of killing him before it reaches you or having defense/HP enough to tank him.<br />
Shock Flower is more eye candy than a real attack, with enough lightning resistances you&#8217;ll simply laugh at it as usual.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You should have enough poison resistances to not feel the real burn of PF. If you do, then there&#8217;s no real problem with them.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Using aftershave is recomended after fighting these monsters. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Lousy physical damage, the only problem would be PF, but you already have maxed resistances, don&#8217;t you?... Don&#8217;t you??</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Buzzsaw</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Heavy melee physical attack, casts Starburst (Magic) on attack and opens wounds.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> He may look like a simple mosquito, but he&#8217;s a real ninja! <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well... you don&#8217;t want this guy close, believe me, you don&#8217;t. Ranged characters should run around, shooting behind of them once every ten minutes until they die.<br />
For melee characters the thing is a little more tricky, you should have enough def for the melee attack to not be a real problem... but if you just stand still when fighting them, their Starburst proc will efficiently cut you in about 654 pieces even despite of the fact you just hammered the potion button.<br />
Starburst doesn&#8217;t deal damage immediately, so once you see the shuriken flurry quit attacking and move until they disappear, dodging them is fairly easy.<br />
Note that trying to tank Starburst is pointless, the damage per hit is just too high and Magic can&#8217;t be easily resisted.<br />
<em>Buzzsaw for summoners!</em>-> Necros laugh at these monsters because of their minions being MAGIC immune; other summoners, like Druids, don&#8217;t. I can only reccomend an obvious boost of the damage and HP of minions and patience.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> There&#8217;s a common misconception with the name of these mobs, they hunt people, not trees. They <em>live</em> in trees. Kthx.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Beta 47 and poison resistances in case you don&#8217;t want to have to consider using a pot when the poison effect ends.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged/Melee poison attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Actually just the same ol&#8217; Jungle Hunter from before, but you&#8217;ll see... some years ago, a member of that tribe bited his tongue when shooting and the darts were all bloody, hence everybody laughed at him (pigmy fighters have a strange humor sense) and called him &#8220;Blood Hunter&#8221;. Since that day he exiled himself to the sewers and raised his own tribe of self-tongue-biter hunters.<br />
One day, he swears, the ones who laughed at him will face the superior bloody onslaught of the Blood Hunters.<br />
Yeah, kinda too unforgiving for such a little guy.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Wouldn&#8217;t be a problem even if you had no poison resistances...<br />
Don&#8217;t try, though.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Average IQ :320.... per pack :P<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They still go on trying to poison you even despite you just explained them you have maxed poison resistances... :roll: Idiots.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fetish Sniper</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Spits poisoned scimitars that cast a extremely low ranged Venomous spirit when they hit something. Invisiblility.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> They&#8217;ve developed such an advanced technology that, by using matter shifters placed at the end of their weapons, they can make the darts morph into <em>friggin&#8217;</em> scimitars when they shoot.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> While the base damage component of the scimitars isn&#8217;t too hard to stand, the Venomous Spirit they cast when they hit anything is very dangerous. Even with maxed poison resistances, getting sniped by them is awful. The easiest solution is moving to avoid the hits.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fetish Hunter</strong></span> ELITE </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee poisoned attack, invisibility.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Flies as a butterfly&#8230;no, sorry. Runs as a rat, stinks as a pig.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Unworthy of the elite title. Chop him by the half and feed the dogs with the remains. Then burn their feces.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Rat Man</strong></span></span> <em>Always spawns as a champion bcuz being a champ is da sh*t, man!</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing, ofc.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Is the simple fact of existing an skill? No? Ok, then nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> From a parallel, imbalanced reality, this champion type of monster is  very shy and may not answer to the summoning rites that theoretically should call him.<br />
Also it&#8217;s whispered that their AI is all screwed up because of our world&#8217;s new, improved and more challenging monsters, the overhelming aura of power makes them tremble in fear, unable to attack under any circumstance.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> So, we have an enemy with lousy HP that doesn&#8217;t attack and whose only action is walking to you and looking with a stupid look in his face...God, someone call the tacticians!</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bullfrog</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Charge (which ignores your avoidance), Fire melee attack; also pierces fire resistance by &#8211;amount still to be found-.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Leaping lardass who actually only has enough stamina to jump in desired direction once, inertia does the rest.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Charge is dangerous, getting charge locked even more, hence, kill them as they run to you or rush to maniacally smack them to death (because while they should KB you and charge lock you, if you&#8217;re a melee character you&#8217;ll have attack/ hit recovery speed enough to hit them, tanking their charge and then killing them before they lock you).</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Acid Prince</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Charge, which ignores your avoidance, poison melee attack, casts Frog Prince on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>All hail Acid Reign!</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Beware their charge attack, but also be very careful with their death effect. Either get away from the novas or rush to punch the nose of the apparition as the frog dies, they hit very hard and might even do some damage with maxed cold resistance.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Marbled Frog</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Charge (avoids your avoidance (ironic, ain&#8217;t it?)) , physical melee attack and slows you on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Known by adventurers as the &#8220;most annoying mobs&#8221; of whole Act III, they don&#8217;t last long, but their curse does.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Watch out for them, since if they charge lock you things can go south pretty fast. A way to stop the charge lock process is getting next to a wall/river/something that won&#8217;t let them KB you, since no KB = no charge chain.<br />
Ignoring charge, high defense does help for melee combat. Ranged characters should keep moving to avoid them and shoot blindly with their AoE skills, remembering that they&#8217;re not tanks and that getting slowed is pretty bad for them.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Jungle Rat</strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Homing targeting poisoned spikes, Spike Nova death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Believe it or not, it used to be a giraffe. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> *please insert your favourite variation of &#8220;Lol. You suck&#8221; here*</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Cruciator</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Shoots <em>friggin&#8217;</em> targeting fire blades, casts both a Spike Barrage and a short ranged Spike Nova on death. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>Pikachu, I choose you!</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You&#8217;re very lucky that they only appear in some of Kurast&#8217;s reliquaries, because these li&#8217;l fellows hit VERY hard. Even with max fire resistance they deal a extremely large damage amount, which is highened because of their fast attack speed and the fact that they almost always come in 4-6 packs.<br />
Defense helps... yet still I suspect them to have some % of ITD (Ignore Total Defense), because even with a 5% Chance to be Hit, they do hit way too often. <br />
So instead of standing there, move and pot for your life. The good thing is that  they should die pretty soon.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Flame Weaver</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Fire melee attack, casts Fireball (that explodes on striking) on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Another clan of mages that was punished by Lazkarum to live trapped inside of an animal. These ones could summon the powers of fire and drop 30K Meteors on the heads of their enemies.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Get some defense and fire resistance, you won&#8217;t feel the burn.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Cabalist</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Gamma Field and Cold Beam.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Famous because of their moving cabalettas.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Cold Beam is shiny, but it&#8217;s damage is so utterly and absolutely suxy that unless you have negative resistances you may not notice it actually didn&#8217;t miss you.<br />
Gamma Field is more tricky, with some resistances it won&#8217;t really damage you too much while you are in battle, but it will last quite a long while and make your hp eventually go to one *shrugs* however, you have pots, don&#8217;t you?</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Tree of Life</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Heavy melee physical attack, casts Inner Fire on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> This is in fact an old version of the monster, since the <em>Yggdrasil vs. Modsbylaz</em> lawsuit, the name was considered plagiarized and changed into &#8220;Tree of not-death&#8221;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They&#8217;re relatively slow, but they hit very hard, obvious suggestions are DoT and range. If you must fight in melee try your best to get some defense and also abuse potions. Also be careful, because this is likely to be a long fight, the good thing is that they don&#8217;t usually come in packs.<br />
(Thanks to [clueso] for noting the ctc% Inner Fire)</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Plague Bringer</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee extremely heavy poison attack, cast Gigantic SuperLaggy Nova of Poison, pierces poison resists by: 25/50/75%.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Smell... bad... *cough* <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Poison resistance is your only hope, and remember that they&#8217;ll pierce it so stack it already (obviously, NOBODY will stack poison resistance just in case they come across them, but still :P) .<br />
Melee characters won&#8217;t really notice the damage from the nova, since once the mobs themselves hit them their HP will almost insta-drop to the floor. These are the kind mobs you need pots to tank, but there&#8217;s a good part, though, their AR pretty much sucks ;).</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Skull Ape</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts a directional stunning shockwave when damaged.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>Everybody, clap your hands!</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Weak AoE skills aren&#8217;t reccomended, while you can stand a bunch of waves without getting stunlocked, if a whole pack of them gets in &#8220;it&#8217;s stun time&#8221; mode at a time they are likely to lock you, leaving you weak to any other random mob that passes by. <br />
Note that the shockwave itself doesn&#8217;t deal any damage and that the chance they have to use it is higher the lower their life gets, after a cetain point ( ~1/4 of total HP) they will use it until they die.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Black Baboon</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts a directional stunning shockwave when damaged. (This is copy+paste :D)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Even today, he still looks for his banana.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Hitting him causes him to spit a stunning bolt towards you, but on the other hand not hitting him causes him to hit you and kill you....don&#8217;t even consider it and rush to maniacally maul his face!</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Dark Gibbon</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts a directional stunning shockwave when damaged. (This is more copy+paste :D:D)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Lurk in the darkness, preparing world domination plans and deciding the strategic locations to shoot bananas at invaders.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Stuning waves can be easily dodged, also direct combat isn&#8217;t too much of a problem, since if you&#8217;re going to fight them in melee you are quite likely to be ready to face the minor challenge of their physical attack.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Monkey King</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast OMGWTFexploding barrels (fire damage) from offscreen (about a whole screen away), also has a melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Not a parody of Donkey Kong. &#8211;<em>Said he, butchering the pun.</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Fire resistance for the Barrels; there&#8217;s no real problem with their damage, though, but they have a gigantic range and if they start hitting you when you&#8217;re fighting other monsters things may get ugly.<br />
If that happens, use your common sense, drink pots and move, because the thing is that it takes those barrels a huge while to land, moving a yard or two might be enough.<br />
The physical damage of the melee attack shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. <br />
By the way, these monsters are (almost) static.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They can deal some decent damage even if you have good resistances,  but they&#8217;re fragile and their missiles are easy to avoid.</ul></p>

Another thing, they happen to be immune to piercing directional ranged attacks such as Ghost Arrow or Bear Claw.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> The unliving proof that zombies can be killed.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Ugly blue zombies die ez, but you really should get <em>the hell</em> out of HB&#8217;s range, unless you have decent resistances it will deal pretty much high damage... If only monster HB hadn&#8217;t been NURFED to hell due to whinning by adding an insane NextDelay, of course.<br />
HB&#8217;s power comes from a extreme amount multihits, so the damage per frame is kinda low. Now each mob HB hits only once with ridiculously low damage, in fact, if you kill a pack of zombies at a time the first hit of a HB will protect you from the following ones...<br />

Be how it be, if they happen to be faster than you or you&#8217;re a melee character, rush to a nearby wall/corner/tree/whatever so that the whole pack can&#8217;t hit you at a time.<br />

However, they&#8217;re not likely to kill you that way if you have decent resistances, even getting the full blast in the face will do so-so damage, and due to the way missiles spread you can&#8217;t get hit by all the fireballs in the first place even despite the skill doesn&#8217;t have ND.</ul></p>

Potions are the answer, because even if as a ranged character you manage to avoid melee hits, their sparkles are likely to hit you for ? damage.<br />
Also their AoE proc helps them fight multiple targets, making life harder for summoners... well... just go on summoning until they die.<br />
Note that all of their abilities are weapon based, hence, defense will be extremely useful when fighting them.</ul></p>

Magic missiles unfortunately aren&#8217;t such an easy problem. Since magic res gear is rare, it&#8217;s reccomended to either get rid of them very fast without caring about the damage or range them, moving to avoid the missiles. Or you could use pots :roll:.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple, these flying aberrations are a quite easy prey for heroes that have decent cold resistances, as long as they don&#8217;t stand still for Countdown to explode on their faces, that is.

@Summoners: Despite Countdown is devastating for most summoned creatures, it&#8217;s also true that Summoners know they&#8217;ll have to summon them again sooner or later, these ones just make them have to summon more often.<br />

High defense-> Rush to close range and smack him, War Spirit won&#8217;t deal too much damage if it misses you.<br />
Low defense-> Run around dodging the hammers and range him trying to not get hit by too many spikes, shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Kill them before the underlings, really, try to ignore everything but them or the Hallucinations will kill you.<br />
Maxed Poison resistance is simply not enough to stop DC from clubbing your HP to one, but it&#8217;ll give you some extra precious seconds you can use to &#8220;tank&#8221; it with a pot and actually kill the Que-Hegan, so that when you come back from town completely healed, the Hallucinations can do nothing but crying and dying at your command.<br />
Of course, actually avoiding the DC poison clouds would be optimal, but I know that most people simply won&#8217;t.<br />
At the time I write this their Psionic Storm deals zero damage, making them simply waste time and effort casting it while they could be killing you with 1337 summoneds and DC. Nooblarz.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> It used to be the common belief that they jumped from the moon on their enemies&#8217; head, hence the name.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Even if you&#8217;re not used to tank, their damage pretty much sucks, so you should be ok. However, watch out from them locking you in melee while other more dangerous monsters are around (e.g: Archons).<br />
Another reason to get rid of them soon is that Dark Power might give you a headache or two if you let them proc it. (25% Crushing Blow chance, enhanced damage, IAS and magic flat damage aren&#8217;t something to laugh at.)</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Spiral Dance on attack, melee physical attack, slows on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Commander of the Dancing Army, the earth shakes under her marching invisible troops.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Her melee attack is pretty much devastating, but that&#8217;s not your only problem. The thing is that once you see the blue dancing spiral appear, you better get the hell out of it&#8217;s center, if you ignore it and just go on attacking expect the stacked effects of the nova to cut you by the half. (I&#8217;m LYING so that you get scared and think it doesn&#8217;t have ND! But seriously, move anyway.)<br />
All of her attacks are weapon based, hence defense is very helpful. Also another good thing is that she&#8217;s not too fast and that she doesn&#8217;t usually come with friends.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Comment:</strong></span> Tribal fighters whose might changed the tide of several battles, and even wars. For their impressive feats, they got to record several ads for <em>Her-Os, the champion&#8217;s breakfast!</em>&#8482;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> These huge maniacs have pretty high damage by themselves, but on top, they cast GotW to improve it.<br />
The solution is obvious, don&#8217;t let them catch you unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing. Their walk and attack speed is average, so moving should make your job a lot easier <strong>even</strong> if you are a melee character.<br />
Another reason to actually avoid melee contact is that you don&#8217;t want them to proc GotW, unlike other monster buffs you&#8217;ve met until now, this one <strong>does</strong> make a very big difference, boosting greatly physical damage and also giving a noticeable buff to elemental spells of nearby enemies. <br />
Basically, it&#8217;s all about luring them to some free place of the map and then dealing with them, taking your time<br />
Their pack size is usually low, between 2 and 4.</ul><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> If you have fire resisance, there shouldn&#8217;t be any strategy. I mean, you can&#8217;t dodge Apocalypse, and it&#8217;s obvious that you have to get out of the way when you see the sluggish Pyroblast crawling to you.<br />
This last thing could be a problem for cold sorcs (because PB might simply blow your snowballs in one shot), but actually, just casting an Abyss or two on them should kill them.</ul></p>
