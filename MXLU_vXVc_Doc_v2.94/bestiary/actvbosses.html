<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The lost souls of all those Random Unique bosses attacked this once lovely canary at a time, overhelming and possessing him. Just look at the name, it&#8217;s obvious there&#8217;s a RU spirit roaming in there.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~5 Ghost Phoenixes.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> I won&#8217;t say they aren&#8217;t dangerous. But that&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re a boss and his pack, but because they&#8217;re a pack of elites. The only extra danger would be the curse, but kill Graywar first and it&#8217;ll be done.</ul></p>

Lol now? [Y/N] <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 melee Fire Clans.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The first time you kill him, do it on the platform, since some say it affects getting the quest reward or not (would make sense, if vanilla version was static).<br />
Other than that, you should have no problem blasting him and his crowd. Even though you shouldn&#8217;t take a nap on the corpses. Kabooom, you know.</ul></p>

(Actually, it&#8217;s because it used to be Fire Enchanted back in &#8217;08, but anyway :P)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~12 Corruptor Archers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Yeah, sure. All that people who abuse him to farm exp chose him because of being the hardest boss ever. Really.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Hates his father. Really, if only he hadn&#8217;t called him Gorefe<strong>a</strong>st, he&#8217;d have an oskill named after him now. And everybody knows that rocks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Extra Fast Sons of Lucion.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Again, I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re easy, but their strength comes from being elites, not a boss pack.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> She shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to beat, but however, just a note. They&#8217;ll cast Bloodstorms right on you, meaning you can perfectly take a nap on them without taking any damage.<br />
Watch out if you have to move, though, the firelazor will shoot at you with it&#8217;s full win.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Extra Fast Serafiends.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They will insta-teleport on you and lock you in melee. While freaking out and running away would be feasible, there&#8217;s no need to, just smackazor them and pot as usual.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span>  ~6 Silver Constructs.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Again, this is one of the most farmed bosses. People wouldn&#8217;t farm him if they couldn&#8217;t wtfpwn him in miliseconds<br />
If from some reason you happen to have trouble with him, you can always corner yourself, only letting three of them attack you at a time.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Nihlathak</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Nihlathak.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Halls of Vaught.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Extra Strong. Not any extra modifiers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Nihlathak does &#8220;losta strange stuff&#8221;:</p>

<p>Death Shards-> Uses a nearby corpse to shoot out a flurry of weapon damage spikes. They have no ND.</p>

<p>Blink-> Teleports and stuns on arrival.</p>

<p>Hunting Banshee-> Spirit that chases a random enemy and explodes releasing a frost nova, without ND.</p>

<p>Rathma&#8217;s Unchosen-> No kidding, that&#8217;s how the .txts call it. It actualy makes sense, since it&#8217;s a different skill.<br />
It targets a monster close to him, turning it invulnerable to all damage (but Damage over Time) and adding 10-15K magic damage to his attacks. For 5 ridiculous seconds.</p>

<p>Call Rust Fury-> He spawns a Rust Fury to cast RU on and annihilate you.</p>

<p>Necrotic Shield-> Regenerates 1/16 life per second. :)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Possibly the less slain quest boss ever. Let&#8217;s face it, nobody cares about Anya (Drehya), her revenge and honor. Do your own dirty job, kthx.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple. Lure every monster away from him and kill them. Then come back and begin to smack him with AoE attacks so that whenever he spawns a new Rust Fury it dies pretty much instantly. Repeat until he dies.<br />
Just one thing to watch out for, Death Shards:<br />
That is a very powerful weapon attack, likely to hit you a lot even if you have good defense. The best way to stop it from crippling you is simply staying away from corpses or eating them before he does.<br />
Stopping his regeneration is easy too, get a source of Open Wounds (only works with weapons) or poison and he won&#8217;t heal.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Brokenstorm</span></strong></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Icy Cellar (Heroic Dungeon).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Cold Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Mindy Flay, dies in miliseconds.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> There&#8217;s a full of win creature of the darkness in every game. <br />
Even pokemon had Misty.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~5 Black Ice Demons.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Yeah, sure. So you&#8217;re in a Heroic Dungeon, and you have problems with Mr. Elite SU boss and his Elite followers? Come on.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Talic</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Talic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Arreat Summit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong, Spectral Hit. No extra modifiers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Whirlwind, melee physical attack. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The only nephalem spirit with common sense. It&#8217;s whispered that in the dawn of time, some desig-...erm... <em>demigods</em> wanted to force him to dual wield, but he looked at them seriously and with a sharp &#8220;that sucks&#8221; turned their offer down. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Actually, the three spirits have seen better times and are not properly prepared for the change Sanctuary has experimented. You should have no problem with them.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Korlic</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Korlic.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Stone Skin. No extra modifiers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Leap Attack. Il Mario Style!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The blood of the nephalem had already started to lose part of it&#8217;s incredible might when the three were born. Proof of this is the fact this one was fooled into believing that two handed weapons rock.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Omg, you can&#8217;t be serious. Their attacks are SLOW, meaning you can perfectly move and heal while they swing.<br />
Perhaps you&#8217;ve been fooled by your life orb&#8217;s display all this time. You&#8217;ll see, life in D2 is binary! Yeah, either you have 1 (= alive, max HP) or 0 (=dead) HP. Anything that doesn&#8217;t headshoot you can be outhealed and therefore is laughable.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Madawc</span></strong></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> d0u8l3 7hr0wn4g3! Also curses on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Some heretic barbarian cults have the theory of Madawc and Korlic actually being ridiculed spirits placed there to sway fools away from the righteous&#8217; path. I seriously mean, Double Throw? O rly?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> I see... so you want an strategy for <strong>Madawc</strong>, eh?<br />
Well, first of all, ignore the other two spirits that can ocasionally hit you <em>and</em> deal damage. Now cast Dark Summoning...</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Oh, the good times. When a succubus could fly through the night sky, slaying left and right with Disco Inferno:<br />
"BrotherLaz" wrote:<br /><blockquote>SUCCUBUS<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~7 Darksisters.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> I&#8217;ll supose you don&#8217;t just cheese them.<br />
There willl be a lot of Dis from the Elite succubi in the room if you just wait there for Baal to summon them. Once you have slayed everything in the room, jump into a TP, get ready and give the death effects time to disappear. Once that&#8217;s done, jump back slay them fiercely, it shouldn&#8217;t actually be too hard, you know. Jump into another portal after you slay them all.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~4 Extra Fast Bane Monsters. Also spawns with a pack of cold skeleton casters, but those suck too much to do anything at all.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Their cool looking Flash attack crashes against your lightning resistance, failing epically. Please, punch their respective faces in and laugh out loud.<br />
Bur first, lure them away from the sight of Baal. Why? Because Static Trap will remain there when the LoD eats the corpses, ready to stun you for the next fight.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> This perfectly shows the twisted wickedness of Hell: They swapped the titles of monsters, so that heroes get confused and supose that, obviously, the &#8220;Knight&#8221; version has to be worse than the &#8220;Lord&#8221; version, which they just pwnt.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~11 Obsidian Knights.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, watch out. Your maxed out poison res means nothing to them, and with a pot you&#8217;ll barely manage to make your HP not crush down.<br />
You need a pretty good defense amount now, so that their multielemental hits don&#8217;t cripple too often.<br />
Keep your TPs open.Use lolsummons (Daystars) to tank a tiny bit when they&#8217;re summoned (they might actually last more than a tiny bit, mainly because they won&#8217;t get insta-gibbed by BLS, so the minotaurs will actually have to kill them with weapon swings) and... well... pray yoo ov enef DMGZ.</ul></p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Liches are irrelevant here, why did you even mention them?</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;C-L-I-C-H-E-S.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Well, I&#8217;m the one who got stabbed in the ear, remember? *cough*<br />
... Anyway... I don&#8217;t try to &#8220;corrupt&#8221; you, hero... I simply offer you a different path, for those suposed allies of yours will betray you when I am gone.<br />
I know that the &#8220;Archangel&#8221; Tyrael, for example, has the plan of opening a portal for you, telling you that it&#8217;ll take you to a peaceful life...<br />
But he will only keep you into it, caged with your memories of this grotesque war until any remain of sanity in your mind is gone.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>And once you are just an empty shell, he&#8217;ll throw you in this world again, all alone and defenceless to die. That&#8217;s why you must help me! Together, we&#8217;ll be kings of this world for all the forthcoming millenia!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m not immortal, you know. Selling this world for about 30 years of so-so control? No, thanks&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t be such a fool! I could grant you immortality right here and now! You just have to come to my side.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;(... That&#8217;s interesting...)&#8221;</p>

<p>-Send Tyrael, Cain and all the others to hell and make a pact with Baal?-<br />
[Yes/Yes]</p>

<p>Baal lets out a shout of joy as you take your decision. With a gesture, he creates the most obscenely powerful gear you had ever dreamed about, and explains you (while you leer at the fancy black, bad dude like, armor) that in order to grant you immortality, he has to kill you first (&#8220;<em>just to refresh stats</em>&#8221;, he says).<br />
So you let him kill you.<br />
And now you&#8217;re DEAD.</p>

<p>Good job. Really.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Nothing! But dozens of Visions of Destruction scattered all across the room, that is.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Facing the truth, Baal won&#8217;t be as hard as you could expect him to be.</p>

<p>Right when you get into the Worldstone Chamber you&#8217;ll be surrounded by Visions of Destruction, yeah. But they actually have lousy HP, so if you have enough defense and pot fast enough you should be able of tanking them for the few seconds killing them will take.</p>

<p>Once that&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>-Move slowly, so that only one Vision sees you at a time and get rid of them, then lure Baal to the already free side of the room and proceed to stab his eye with a fork repeatedly. He moves very fast even if he&#8217;s slowed AND will keep you perma-slowed, so you possibly won&#8217;t be able of ranging him too easily. Get extra def. to make up for the forced melee range.<br />
Also resistances aren&#8217;t required for this fight, he doesn&#8217;t have even one elemental attack. So you really should go all out on defense rating, because his Rust Storm will take most of it away.</p>

<p>-Summoners don&#8217;t have a too hard enemy here, too. Their mobs will soon get rid of the first wave of  Visions. Then moving slowly and perhaps summoning a lonely monster to lure them in tiny groups will do as well.<br />
Then it&#8217;ll be only you, your army and Baal. I personally prefer Blinking once on him, with my full army ready and then letting them tank as I kill him myself.</p>

<p>*yawn*...And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m off.<br />
Night.</ul></p>
