<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Gloom</strong></span> <br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning based melee attack, Charge (Physical attack with running start, knocks you back and ignores avoidance)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Not aerodynamic, but can fly anyway.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Avoid that a pack of them rushes to you, or you might get badly hurt, VERY badly, in fact. A charge will KB you, leaving you vulnerable to another charge, which will leave you vulnerable to another one, which... Well, you possibly got the point already.<br />
In order to avoid that, if you see they&#8217;re going to charge lock you get yourself next to a wall, since if they don&#8217;t KB you they can&#8217;t charge anymore.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning attack, casts Claw Tornado on attack (weapon based (1/2 damage) skill which hits multiple times (it has a ND of 4))<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> It&#8217;s huge and hard, but it&#8217;s still just a bug.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not letting them corner you when being attacked by other mobs is a good idea, but in fact these guys don&#8217;t really pose a threat.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Unholy Scarab</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Claw Tornado on attack, Lightning melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Should we supose that there are Holy Scarabs too?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> As long as they don&#8217;t corner you, you shouldn&#8217;t have any problem... and even if they do, you shouldn&#8217;t have an problem anyway.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Tomb Guardian</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Claw Tornado on attack, lightning melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Former tomb protector spirit, now turned to destroy.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Where&#8217;s the insecticide?</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Tomb Curse</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning attack, casts Claw Tornado on attack, calls hostile Darkwarden on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Urban legends say that they can outlast a nuclear bomb. As Beacon sins have proved, they can&#8217;t.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Melee combat isn&#8217;t the best choice, mainly because their simple attack is pretty strong and their Claw Tornado is likely to kill you if you get to low life and attempt to chicken out. But that&#8217;s not the worst part... they call Darkwardens on attack... and Darkwardens are bad.<br />
Range is obviously reccomended, if you really don&#8217;t have any other way than melee, then dive in, hit a few times and get away before they call King Kong&#8217;s angry cousin.<br />
Since they only have weapon based attacks, defense is very helpful when fighting them.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Darkwarden</strong> </span> ELITE</span> <em>Summoned by Elite Beetles.</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lolling thunder (basically, a nova of weapon damage that KBs you and multihits. Similar to Retaliate, but without the &#8220;get hit&#8221; factor nor the added magic damage), apocalyptic physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> This specific kind of giant used to roam hell berserkly and happened to have quite a thing for squashing giant beetles. It was Azmodan&#8217;s idea to cage them into talismans to unleash them safely in the middle of battles. Mephisto thought that it&#8217;d be much more fun to make them be summoned by scarabs.<br />
When those two screwed it up, it took Baal quite a while to change their AIs so that they were actually &#8220;friends&#8221; of the bugs and didn&#8217;t squash them right after appearing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> If this is the first time you come across this monster, please profit of his low speed and recover your corpse. Done? Good.<br />
You really should leave him alone, I know that you might consider that &#8220;lol fleein&#8217; suxorz&#8221;, but you&#8217;re <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> meant to kill this guy at low level. :roll: You still want to kill him, don&#8217;t you? <br />
---KILL ALL THE BEETLES BEFORE, ALSO GET RID OF OTHER ANNOYING MONSTERS AROUND---<br />
Ok, ranged characters should simply keep a distance and <em>range</em> him, I know it&#8217;s shocking. More or less same for casters, simply don&#8217;t let him catch you at all. Summoners should also just keep summoning over and over until he dies.<br />
The thing is: &#8220;What the heck do melee chars do?&#8221; There are two options:<br />
Ez mode-> Buy a few &#8220;Stun attack&#8221; MOs or get yourself some other stun source, then once you start hitting him it&#8217;s done.<br />
Real man mode-> Dive in, hit twice, flee-> Dive in, hit twice, flee -> Dive in, hit twice, flee... Just don&#8217;t let him touch you or you&#8217;ll be dead meat. Maybe you can hit a few more times before fleeing if you have a decent defense rating.<br />
Of course, if you think you can tank a pack of these monsters then you should leave drugs, seriously, that sh*t&#8217;s no good for you.<br />
-Remember that you don&#8217;t have to kill anything in your way, we won&#8217;t laugh at you if you don&#8217;t. Or maybe we will, but you won&#8217;t know, so it doesn&#8217;t matter.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Prowler</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Mark of the wild on striking and melee/ranged (javelins) physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Luckily for you, they don&#8217;t really prowl. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Show them who is the master of the beta 47.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Prowler Priestess</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Abracadabra.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged/melee physical attack, has Fanaticism (damage/ attack speed increasing aura) mapped under the rmb.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Many ignore the reason why this kitten can actually use an aura... I count myself among the ignorants, too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple, while aura looks pretty cool and stops charmers from commanding these monsters, it actually doesn&#8217;t rise the damage to any noticeable amount, therefore you don&#8217;t really have to worry about killing them first, despite it&#8217;s reccomended.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Sun Tiger</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts a slow moving directional fire ball that explodes on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Member of the Sun&#8217;s priesthood, this kind of feline is an adept at spellcasting.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Yet once again, unless you have negative fire resistance they won&#8217;t actually do anything.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Moon Panther</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast slow moving directional lightning balls that releases charged bolts on striking. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> They make covens at full moon nights where they explicitly rub each others to gather an electrostatic charge and improve their arcane powers... wish you were a cat, don&#8217;t you? ;)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> While those covens look interesting, they hardly achieve any real  improvement with them, in short: lit res + beta 47.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Desert Cat</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Mark of the Wild, melee or ranged physical attacks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;Meow, I&#8217;m gonna rip out your filthy innards, meow.&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Nothing to worry about.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Desert Priestess</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Fanaticism aura, also buffs herself with Mark of the Wild when striking with her ranged physical attacks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> From the werecats lost tribes of the desert, this kind of feline channels the power of long time forgotten deities and empowers her allies&#8217; blows with their arcane might. (Who said I can&#8217;t be serious, eh? :P)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The buff from her aura is fairly weak, but well, it&#8217;s always better to kill her first, just in case.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Black Cat</strong> </span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged physical attack, casts Nightmare on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The number of trucks that run over grannies dramatically increases when these cats are around.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> While they&#8217;re not dangerous by themselves, Nightmare slows you down (a lot) and that renders you extremely vulnerable to other monsters, also, it stops your summoned / reanimated monsters from healing in any way; in order to avoid that, kill them first and try to avoid the javelins.</ul><br />
(Thanks go to Sing_In_Silence for making me realize that PMH actually works on player&#8217;s minons :P)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Corruptor Mage</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Poison Hands.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Once again, some random undead with shiny white bones that poisons you from a distance, did you <em>actually</em> check what that green glowing thing they hurl at you is?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They can only be really dangerous in a couple situations, like when you&#8217;re locked in melee and they poison you from behind the mobs wall. <br />
However, with some decent poison resistances, some &#8220;Reduced poison length&#8221; (NPCs sell it as a MO modifier) and trying to avoid the (pretty slow) bolts, you shouldn&#8217;t really have trouble with them.<br />
Also remember that their moving speed is pretty high and that they will flee from melee combat.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fell Pit Fiend</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, shoot a weapon based ball of more physical damage.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Fell down a pit when they were younger, never got over it.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Some defense will be enough to tank them the little time you&#8217;ll need to send them back to their pit, ranged characters should laugh at their pathethic speed and kill them while they&#8217;re 20 yards away.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Sand Devil</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Poison melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Are you wondering why out of all of the demons, these spiders are the ones carrying the &#8220;Devil&#8221; title? *points to Astrogha, sitting in his infernal throne*<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Beta 47 pl0x.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Hivehost</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical/poisoned attack, calls hostile Brood Swarm on attack, casts directional Carpet of Spiders on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Instead of actually burying the eggs of the bees in the victim&#8217;s flesh, as many seem to believe, what they actually do is spraying his face with an extremely bad smelling liquid, which guides those insects hordes to their foe.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Ok, first of all, standing in a place when fighting them is a bad idea, even if you&#8217;re a melee char <strong>move</strong>, if you stay still you&#8217;ll get yourself locked due to the summoned packs and killed when they proc their CoS. <br />
If you manage to actually keep moving, they won&#8217;t be a real threat, use your most devastating (or less suxy :P) abilities against them, focus on the spiders themselves, ignoring the bees or any other random mobs.<br />
(Note: I would suggest not ignoring Darkwarden type monsters, though :P)</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Brood Swarm</strong></span> ELITE</span> <em>Summoned by Hivehosts</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical melee attack&#8482;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> They might be small, but their spectral power is high... and it sort of hurts when they all bite your butt, too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Since all they do is following you  around and attacking in melee, the Beta 47 is the perfect solution... once you&#8217;ve gotten rid of the Hivehosts, that is.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Blood Stinger</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Phys melee attack, opens wounds, casts Poison Flash on attack, also drains stamina... but who gives a damn about stamina anyway?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> He stings, you bleed, the usual.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> As long as you have some poison resists, these guys are pathetically ridiculous and ridiculosly pathethic.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Undead Vulture</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Physical melee attack, casts Bloodlust (buffing skill) on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Now, look who was the one eating carrier pidgeons!!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They suck by themselves... but their Bloodlust death is no joke, try to leave them for last when fighting packs of other mobs unless you want to feed them extra damage.<br />
Also, they&#8217;re totally invulnerable when flying.<br />
And just a note, many times once they land they&#8217;ll turn out to still be invulnerable to <strong>every single</strong> of your attacks, no matter if spell or weapon based, that&#8217;s a sort of bug which will fix by itself once they begin moving. Take it as another hint telling you that you should kill other stuff first.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Oasis Guard</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, invulnerability on flight, casts Bloodlust on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Likes to sit on picnic tables.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Leave them for last, you don&#8217;t want to buff all the other other mobs around, do you?</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Pit Knight</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Pounce, Fire based melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Though it looks cute all that, it&#8217;s not friendly at all... Yeah, just realized you chose the wrong side, didn&#8217;t you?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You won&#8217;t see them getting close, they&#8217;ll just Pounce on you  and then begin whacking you with those big bad swords of them. Nothing you can&#8217;t actually withstand.<br />
Btw, do yourself a favor and remember they they reproduce by tainting human corpses, hence you can&#8217;t score with them <em>anyway</em>, it&#8217;s just not physically possible.<br />
Sucks, I know.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Asatruar</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Punisher with no timer at distance, but for some reason just physically whacks you with that stick of him when he&#8217;s at melee range.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong><em>Comment by Diablo, Prime Evil of Terror, original designer of these monsters:</em></strong></span> &#8220;Oh, yeah *giggles* you&#8217;ll see, so that they actually didn&#8217;t collapse after casting three Punishers in a row, we had to delete a pretty much huge part of their AI, so now once they actually reach you in melee they prefer chasing you and hitting your skull with their bat instead of casting again *winks*&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Pretty obvious, avoid getting crippled by the first extremely slow Punishers wave, then kill them whichever way you prefer.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Raider</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Slowing physical melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Skilled warriors of a pigmy tribe of the dessert, they have allied with Hell&#8217;s legions in exchange for... meh, you possibly can guess it by yourself.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not a real threat due to their slow attack/moving speed, but still they can pack a punch, beware of getting locked by them and their pretty long attack range.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Crusher</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Always angry, there&#8217;s no room for talk.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They&#8217;re VERY slow, but in exchange they can pack quite a punch when they hit you. Hence, range is better than melee combat. However, they&#8217;re not <em>that</em> strong, with some defense you might find yourself tanking them with relative ease.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Daystar</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Angelfire! Obviously fire elemental spell. Also a dreaded physical melee slap.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>May the daystar light your path. On fire.</em> &#8211;Laz.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple, Angelfire is a powerful spell because it doesn&#8217;t have NextDelay and therefore it hits you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>twenty fricking five</em></strong></span> per each second you stay into it. The fact that you actually notice that the HP globe goes down instead of simply auto-emptying is already showing you that the damage per frame is pretty low, so then, the obvious hints are moving and getting a very decent fire resistance. Also you can get some &#8220;Magic Damage Reduction&#8221;, which, with relatively low amounts, will negate almost (if not totally) all damage.<br />
(Thankees go to Sing_In_Silence for the MDR tactic idea and test ^^).<br />
However, moving is cheaper. <br />
You should also note that these mobs do have melee atacks (laughable of course), exploit them! You don&#8217;t want to be yards away from them so that they can crisp you in seconds, you want to get closer and stab them in their respective livers with a rusty spoon while they attempt to slap you.<br />
-Just a note about Angelfire itself, it&#8217;s actually a trap with pretty wide trigger radius, the fact that you never see the shining light when Daystars attack you is because they cast it right on your head, making it trigger instantly.<br />
This is quite more noticeable if you get allied Daystars and simply kill faster than them. If you killed a monster in the moment when they were casting Angelfire, it won&#8217;t trigger it.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Gargoyle</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Ligthning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning melee attack, casts Shower of Rocks on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> *looks at the rocks raining down from the sky*... Maybe they didn&#8217;t want a tea, after all...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple, the avalanche can be easily dodged, it has a 2 seconds delay since you see the &#8220;impact zone&#8221; on the ground. Once you see it, move.<br />
Getting locked in melee by these monsters is almost impossible... but if you do, you&#8217;re pretty much doomed. Note that defense helps dodging the stones.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Magic Missiles, Stunning melee physical attack and cast Arcane Fury on attack .<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> They have managed to merge thousands of years of knowledge and millions of arcane words into a single devastatingly powerful magical word: Croak.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Magic damage is usually a problem since common gear doesn&#8217;t usually give any Magic resistance, this is pretty much an exception, though. <br />
Not because the spell won&#8217;t hurt, it will, but they&#8217;re not likely to last enough to really cast it more than twice. Also, don&#8217;t expect them to actually proc Arcane fury and start casting, they&#8217;re not that smart.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical onslaught, also cast a self-only speed boost on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> You thought that there were not FLIYING POLAR GOATMANS, didn&#8217;t you? Well, you were right, they don&#8217;t fly :P<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> It is much better to lure them away from the caster before actaully killing them, if you don&#8217;t then the mix of physical, magic and cold damage is most likely to kill you. If you manage to lure them out of his range, though, they&#8217;ll die pretty soon.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Ice Clan</strong></span> ELITE</span> <em>Caster edition!</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Pain Spirit (magic damage), uses Ice Clan corpses (only) to cast Shatter the Flesh, damage increases as life lowers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> After biking across Europe with his faculty pals for a year, he has finally decided to finish his thesis about the effects of ice on human flesh; currently doing some tests on the field.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Unless you want them to Shatter your Flesh, luring his melee pals is reccomended, kill them out of his range and then come back and kill him whichever way you prefer. Remember that he won&#8217;t use other corpses to cast StF than Ice Clan&#8217;s.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Mummy&#8217;s Sarcophagus</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> NOTHING SUPER-DUPER LOL.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Calls hostile Genies ( real skill name = Rub Lamp)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Not your mummy&#8217;sarcophagus...  I think.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> It&#8217;s often better killing the thing that spawns your enemies before dealing with those enemies themselves.<br />
On an unrelated note, some say that fire is the best way to fight fire, that&#8217;s stupid: The best way to fight fire is to place several particle-disruptor-thingie-dee units that, by projecting a delta waves concentrated beam, change the electron&#8217;s charge of the air in their effect&#8217;s zone and turn the oxygen into something not flammable... like cheez.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Genie</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cold melee attack, invisibility.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Will grant you three wishes.... not.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> While you <em>should</em> destroy the sarcophagus that spawned them first, there&#8217;s no real need of strategy for these ones. Note that in some places they&#8217;ll spawn <em>all by themselves</em>.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Sand Maggot Egg/Young/(Adult)</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> They grow, from egg to young, then from young to adult. The young version has a melee physical attack. The adult one has that same type of attack, it lays eggs and hides under the sand when damaged. Also it can cast a short ranged poison sputter.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Yeah, there&#8217;s hell need of an entry for these ones! Really, you&#8217;ll fight them like... three times in your life ¬¬...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t make me laugh :P</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Poison Spitter</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts poison sputter (a spell, so it ignores def).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Fast moving mutant lizard that spits deadly poison to any foe on sight.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Unless your poison resistance utterly sucks, you should have no problem.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Red Storm</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Flash, leaves trapped corpses.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Despite of his name, Flash is still blue.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> With some lightning resistances they won&#8217;t be match for you, but the thing is that you should avoid stepping on their corpses. They leave a Static Trap on death, that once triggered, releases several stunning bolts; this makes them a pain in the ass for most summoners.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bone Archer</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cold arrows.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Cold to the bone, nothing moves him.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> No real strategy needed here, this is just the typical static ranged random enemy and anything will do when it comes to wtfslay him.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bone Warrior</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee cold attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> So this is what happens when you freeze a Returned...interesting...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Again, beta 47 is enough.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bone Warlock</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Single target Frozen Soul.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Since last fall&#8217;s &#8220;incident&#8221; they can&#8217;t go into Lut-Gholein&#8217;s public library anymore.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> In packs, they might deal slightly decent damage even with good cold resistances, however, their HP suckzors and you can avoid Frozen Souls without too much trouble.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Cursed Soul</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Single target Frozen Soul.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Used to suffer halitosis, but not anymore. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Even ignoring their random AI locks if you force them close to walls, they&#8217;re not dangerous.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Shredder</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Frozen Orb<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Said to be Lazkarum&#8217;s punishment to an ancient clan of magicians whose powers surpassed the limit he had settled for humanity.  <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> With cold resistance you can melee them freely, their FO looks stronger than it really is. However, you might find youself in an icy tomb if you rush into a pack of them <strong>without</strong> cold resistance. Ranged characters can perfectly range them from out of the damage zone of FO.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Ghost Flame</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Lightning melee attack, casts Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> A <strong>flame</strong> that is immune to <strong>poison</strong> and attacks with <strong>lightning</strong>??... I mean wtf.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Ghost or not, they&#8217;re not immune to a good ole axe hack.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Lightning Spire</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Glacial Nova and Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t ask me why it doesn&#8217;t cast Supernova, which would have actually made sense.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You might want to get rid of it before atacking the other mobs, since being frozen is quite likely to slow you down.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Condemned</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Pyroblast and Apocalypse.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> bbq?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> With non totally suxy fire resistances and maybe a hp pot, you&#8217;ll laugh at these pyromaniacs as you do with everything else. Even though you should avoid Pyroblasts.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Sand Raider</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cold melee attack, teleports you on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Loves to wear tall sandals when going out.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They don&#8217;t pose a real threat, but there&#8217;s a chance they could teleport you next to enemies that DO pose a threat, hence killing them before other monsters is pretty much a good idea.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Marauder</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cold melee attack, teleports you on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Having six arms is useful even out of combat.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They don&#8217;t hit hard enough to be a threat, but there&#8217;s always the chance that they tele you into a pack of frenzied monsters, hence, ignoring them isn&#8217;t reccomended.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Magma Demon</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Fire melee attack, casts a wave of fiery rocks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> When the Horadrim caged fire imps into stone they should&#8217;ve thought a little more about the consequences...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Since their spell (rocks wave) ignores defense (like any spell), if you don&#8217;t have good resistances but do have decent defense, melee combat will be better, on the other hand, with low defense but good resistances you might prefer ranging them  and trying to avoid the rocks (fairly easy).</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Tomb Snake</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Charge, which ignores avoidance, and physical melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> They used to be guardian ethereal spirits of ancient evils... One day they realized that being physical and defiling the tombs would be much more fun. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Charge is bad, for it will hit you and KB you, leaving you vulnerable other charges. Getting charge locked by a whole pack of snakes is worse, getting charge locked by the whole pack as other mobs attack you is horrible. Be creative and avoid it, I&#8217;ve said. (A way can be, for example, fighting next to walls so that Charge won&#8217;t KB you, which will stop them from locking you)</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fallen Warrior</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Concentration aura: rises damage, attack rating and attack speed; also melee physical attack and chance to deal crushing blow.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Carry big swords and like cutting people by the half with them; it&#8217;s like their hobby, you know.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The aura buff is pretty much laughable... but well, it might actually be better to get rid of these undead before actually attacking other mobs, mostly because their own damage isn&#8217;t so laughable.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Fire Tower</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Apocalypse.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The undeniable proof of magic requiring a superior intellect and a powerful spirit, is that even inanimate objects can cast it.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You&#8217;re kidding, aren&#8217;t you?</ul></p>
