<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The only reason why the hoi polloi thinks Banshees are monsters that kill people by screaming is that there are, in fact, a lot of girly screams when an unwary hero is caught by them.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> This isn&#8217;t the right place to get randomly teleported, you don&#8217;t want to end up next to angry gigantic mobs. To avoid this, chop their pathethic HP down by looking at them angrily.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> It&#8217;s da <em>real</em> thing! <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not a problem by themselves, but since they&#8217;re invisible they might just sneak behind of you while you try to run away from other monsters and cripple you in a few hits.<br />
If you have the sound turned on, you&#8217;ll hear their ghostly sfx when they are close, that will tell you when you have to start spamming your AoE attacks and moving randomly so that they don&#8217;t make it to hit you, which is important because they move pretty fast. Needless to say, this tactic is meant for ranged characters with low defense rating.<br />
The thing is pretty easy for melee characters and summoners, so no big deal.</ul></p>

What the High Heavens forgot about was the fact that their on death buffs wouldn&#8217;t actually affect the defender of Light who just killed them, but the massive pack of demons that try to murder him. :(<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Whip your AoE attacks into shape and make it so that you kill this li&#8217;l bird guy the last. Really, the only problem is the annoying buff to other monsters on death, avoid it.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Fawkes&#8217; Bad Feather Day. (Nintendo&#8217;s Content balance system, finally revealed: &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a game where you save princesses by shooting flowers to a bad turtle while you ride a pony, then let&#8217;s make up for it by making a game where you **** on dead enemies&#8221;)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Duck and cower! :D Nah, with enough fire resistance Rain of Bombs doesn&#8217;t really deal that much damage... unless you decide that tanking them without moving and letting them hit you over and over is really fun.<br />
Basically, avoid melee contact unless you can withstand heavy physical damage, they&#8217;re not too fast and you can guess were they are by following their slightly blue glow light radius.</p>

<p>Most summoners don&#8217;t really have a problem with them, but if you&#8217;re a totemancer or a cold summonsorc you might find youself resummoning very often... it sucks, but you&#8217;ll have to stick with it.<br />
However, totemancers can always counter the fact of their totems having lousy resistances with a Mana Totem and Unholy Prayer.<br />
Coldsorcs should try to make their mobs keep moving, forcing them to follow her a bit and saving them from the thermonuclear assault.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, at low health, he turns invulnerable to &#8220;all&#8221; incoming damage for a brief time. (He DOESN&#8217;T heal, as the ingame description says)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Ahahahaha... and you thought Titan Strike was good... <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Usually they get killed before they have the chance to turn invulnerable, but if they do, simply hang around for a while killing the other monsters nearby. Once they &#8220;wake up&#8221; they&#8217;ll have the same low hp and will get insta crippled because of your angry stares.<br />
Note that if they turned immune when they were poisoned/ under the effect of any other kind of DoT, they&#8217;ll still be damaged by it.</p>

<p>*There&#8217;s something curious with their immunity effect, if you KB/Stun them when they&#8217;re in stone form, they&#8217;ll &#8220;wake up&#8221; and start attacking, still keeping their immunity shield. This happens to all &#8220;Badbarb&#8221; type monsters with this ability.</ul><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Meh, just keep clicking randomly all across the screen and they&#8217;ll die just like anything else. Btw, the healing factor of their invulnerability shield doesn&#8217;t work (unless their typical, absolutely not noticeable Life Regen is what the ingame description refers to).</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Like Obi Wan Kenobi would say: &#8220;Use the force, <em>dude!</em>&#8221;.<br />
By the way, they don&#8217;t actually heal when they become invulnerable and once they start casting the shield they&#8217;ll just go on over and over. Not like it makes any difference at all, though.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They still don&#8217;t heal, it still wouldn&#8217;t have meant a thing. So cut their hearts out and eat them while they&#8217;re still beating already.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Holy Armor on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Said to be able of casting magic without reading the manual.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Bah, if this is what Inarius was scared of then he sucked more than I imagined.<br />
Their dual hit actually just deals the half of what would be a slightly decent attack, with double chance to miss. I&#8217;m not saying that they can&#8217;t kill you, if a pack of them locks a char with low defense, but actually they move quite slow and also have pretty avoidable attacks.<br />
Summoners should simply zerg rush them, waiting until their shield drops. You can however speed things up dramatically by applying DoT on them, which will ignore their shield. They&#8217;re likely to proc it a lot, so it might take a while if you just let your minons do the job.<br />
Melee characters are likely to cut them in pieces in no time. However, if they happen to turn invulnerable too often, you can just get away until the shield fades away and then striking when the&#8217;re vulnerable.<br />
If you think all of the tactics you&#8217;ve read until now utterly suck... well...<em> you try.</em> Thinking of a way of fighting monsters tactically in a game where everyone dash-kills everything with rainbow AoE damage and without even looking at the mob&#8217;s name isn&#8217;t exactly easy.<br />
Hence, :P.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Kids are scared of the darkness... Kids are scared of spiders... Well, these caring mutant giant spiders at least fixed the problem with darkness :).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t worry, Flash will only deal enough damage if you let a pack of them lock you and they happen to proc it like hell, otherwise they&#8217;re not a problem.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Brood Mother</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Poisoned melee attack, casts directional Carpet of Spiders on attack, calls hostile Broodling on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Originally designed by mankind as a patrolling unit of crop fields, these large spiders carry with them a batallion of smaller spiders they can unleash to rapidly wear any enemy down. In case this wasn&#8217;t enough for tougher beasts, they also were granted the ability to summon more biotechnological minions to outnumber the enemy.<br />
As it was said later, more money should&#8217;ve been invested into AI improves to keep them by the side of good guys.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> The poison from a direct hit lasts for quite a long time, but it can be tanked with a pot. Their CoS proc is a little harder, but fortunately it won&#8217;t last too long.<br />
Now that&#8217;s been mentioned, let&#8217;s get to the tricky part.<br />
They move very fast and have a higher than usual HP amount, this doesn&#8217;t really make them hard to face in melee, but there&#8217;s the fact they keep on summoning Broodlings on attack, which is bad because they might lock you.<br />
However, they&#8217;re not as bad as they seem. Moving every now and then and even cornering oneself in a pinch works for melee characters.<br />
For ranged characters, the thing is pretty obvious. Simply keep moving and make them meet the reaper with your ranged skeelz.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> These predator bugs were created by the same group of alchemists that created Brood Mothers, as a way of keeping the crops safe from werebunnies and things like. But a mistake in their AI programming caused them to target as their enemy the kind that was most of a threat for crop. As a result, hundreds of harvesters were found dead or vanished mysteriously when these lurking biotech calamities were released.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Ignore them until their mommy is dead unless they are really zergrushing you, your AoE attacks should do the trick, however.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Rust Monster</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Rust Storm on striking, increases his Life Regen when fleeing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Fighting for days under the incessant rain took it&#8217;s toll on this fighter in shining armor. The fun sight of knights in rusted armor falling to their knees out of breath and finally been slayed by angry demons inspired Mephisto to create these bashing atrocities.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Rust Storm  <strong>s-l-o-w-s</strong> you down and lessens your defense by a dramatical 75% (= -75% to Total Character Defense), which might be enough to allow other mobs to cripple you if you&#8217;re not used to tank and get locked in melee.<br />
However, the thing is that while they move kinda fast, they attack <em>extremely</em> slow, profit from that and don&#8217;t let them catch you, even though their melee attack is pretty pathethic, not getting hit at all &#8220;is more win&#8221;.<br />
Another note is that once damaged over ? of hp, they&#8217;ll run away, healing unless they have Open Wounds. Be how it be this isn&#8217;t truly important.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> A strange dichotomy noticeable is in these beings too...they no longer considered demons will be. &#8211;Ormus (English: Unlike Rust Monsters, these ones <strong>aren&#8217;t</strong> demons.)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Demons, not demons... Not like anybody really cared about it anyway.<br />
Proceed to smackazor them already, because while their physical attack deals average damage, they attack extremely slow and suck a real lot. Trust me, they do.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Not a renamed clone of Rust Monster. This one also plays the banjo :mrgreen: .<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Rust Storm is the only thing you have to watch out for, and you can avoid it perfectly by simply moving away from him and his extremely slow attack animation. Have I left clear enough the fact that they suck? Ok.<br />
Still, expect them to reduce your minions def. (what def?) and speed to sligthly above zero, Mr/Ms Summoner. There&#8217;s no real way to avoid it... but resummoning :P.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, the curse is bad, but it&#8217;s nothing you actually can&#8217;t stand, mainly due to its short length. Simply click and hold until they &#8220;pass away&#8221;.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, they&#8217;re not a threat by themselves, but Rust Storm will leave you vulnerable to other attacks, so get rid of them even if there are other stronger monsters around.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>PROWL!</em></span></strong> Also has a melee physical attack and casts Rust Storm on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Called that way because all that remains after his charge is a bunch of crushed steel, which once contained a hero.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> ROTFL! And I thought kickass elites had vanished for good! @Laz: +1.<br />
Well, basically you don&#8217;t want them to prowl at you, mainly because they will insta drop your hp to 1, as well as they&#8217;ll proc Rust Storm, leaving you on the verge of death, just waiting for another blow from anything to finish you.</p>

<p>Telling when they&#8217;re prowling or not should be easy, but it can be kind of tricky when you run into them in real battle. So in order to avoid bad surprises, drop two lolsummons (Daystars will serve you well) at their feet when you see them, the first one is likely to get headshot by prowl in a second (but Daystars are immune to poison :P), but the second one will actually tank them for a tiny bit.<br />
Now, if you&#8217;re a melee character, please rush to their melee range and start attacking until all that remains are a few pieces of demonic flesh scattered around.<br />
If you&#8217;re a ranger, simply keep them busy with the lolsummons and do your thing.<br />
Summoners won&#8217;t find a hard enemy in them, for they don&#8217;t have an efficient way of dealing with a swarm of enemies.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Used to be the most seductive demon around (even though they just had to compete with... ugh... mad rogues and zombies), but since Pit Fiend type monsters moved in, they&#8217;ve lost a lot of fans.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> In case some of you don&#8217;t remember, ye good ole Bloodstar used to have KB and actually shot twice per cast. However, this monster version of the spell deals a ridiculously low damage amount and still moves so absolutely slow that not dodging it should, imho, be a reason good enough to get you shot.<br />
Yeah, you could say that &#8220;hey, it will hit me if I&#8217;m melee locked&#8221;, but if you actually try it, you&#8217;ll see that the damage suxzors.<br />
Still, leave them for last if shiny elemental magicks are hitting you.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Killing them under the slaughter of elemental monsters isn&#8217;t recomended, standing next to their death efect so that all of the poison orbs hit you isn&#8217;t a good idea too.

It&#8217;s true that if she snipes you with Death Star while you&#8217;re locked in melee, she might kill you. But however you should have learnt to not get locked in potentially dangerous places.<br />
So the worst thing that she can do is dying, and you can perfectly run away/hide behind a pilar until the poison orbs stop trying to maim you. Note that if you have a large amount of minions, you&#8217;d do better TPing home until it ends.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Watch our for their face-mauling attacks, because not even pots will save you from a string of succesful hits. The best solution for non-tanks is simply keeping a distance and profiting from their average running speed and their slow attacks. Also expect the fight to last a while, since their HP is quite high.<br />
You really don&#8217;t want this guy close, since his AR is impressively high too, and he might still have about 20% Chance to Hit despite of your 50K of defense (I&#8217;m talking about rangers/casters who tend to have low defense).<br />
Melee characters should have enough defense to avoid the hits, so they&#8217;re not a real problem for them.</ul></p>

Basically, it&#8217;s all about taking the few seconds you have while the spirits fly to deal as much damage as possible, then getting away from him (so that the next QQ Legion wave targets some other place) and coming back, repeating this over and over until he dies.<br />
Not a hard enemy for rangers, who can avoid  the spirits easily. Nor for summoners, whose minions are ready to simply stand damage, without caring about the element.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Skeletal ranger that must not move from the place he as been summoned at, for he would lose the poison powers he drains directly from his corpse.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Charming big packs of them is fun! Go and give it a try already ;).<br />
Well, there are a few things to take into a count here.<br />
First of all, their base attack lasts for a very long time, draining your HP to one even if you have maxed resistances; on the other hand, Cloudkill fills a wide zone with decaying gas, which will cripple you much faster than their base attack but won&#8217;t last too long once you get out of the cloud. In fact, it will override the first long lasting poison layer, so it might be even considered helpful sometimes...<br />
This makes them be a very easy prey for ranged characters (who simply avoid the arrows by moving, skelerangers&#8217; attack speed suxorz) and melee characters (who are the bombs on the raids and cripple anything with their suppermassive AoE apocalyptic attacks), the problem is with ye poor summoner crowd:<br />
Let&#8217;s face it, your minions don&#8217;t usually have any good defense, they simply have loads of HP and &#8220;maxed&#8221; elemental resitance, as well as <em>you</em> to resummon them.<br />
Without defense, the arrows will hit them all the time making Cloudkills proc like there was no tomorrow.<br />
On top minions are usually stupid and won&#8217;t get out of the poisoned zone that&#8217;s killing them &#8220;slowly&#8221;, at least not by themselves. So you  have to either let them die wave by wave and resummon over and over until every single skeleton is dead... or you can snipe them from out of their range with some ranged attack of yours.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Despite of the similarities, she&#8217;s absolutely unrelated to the bow user elite demoness she shares her title with. <br />
This one was a member of the elite Barbarian forces (codename: Barbies), which was fully composed of female fighters. The reason why there aren&#8217;t any in Harrogath at the moment is that Qual-Keth&#8217;s &#8220;great&#8221; battle tactics mainly consisted in throwing his best elite soldiers against the first weak wave of Baal&#8217;s minions. They obviously won, but the next 754 waves kinda crushed them before they could retreat and prepare for next battle.<br />
Still, the Three reanimated them by the winners&#8217; side to grant them the chance to take revenge on the stupid barbarian &#8220;tactician&#8221;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Their direct damage isn&#8217;t too outstanding, right, but they move <strong>very</strong> fast (even though the attack speed is a bit more average) and will come in pretty large packs (4-6), so they are likely to lock you and then kill you with their SoR procs, which in case you don&#8217;t know drop 20 rocks each. So despite of you leet def, at least a few will hit you with about 3x their regular damage (due to 3/2 damage modifier on SoR and the phys resistance lowering), possibly smashing you into the ground.<br />
In order to avoid this, keep moving even as a melee character, also remember that if you&#8217;re a ranged character, you can drop a lolsummon as a decoy and then murder them as you do with any other mob.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> It&#8217;s been a long time since the powers of Evil had been trying to make a summoner with decent ranged physical attacks. They have finally succeeded.<br />
These beings, half physical and half ethereal, shoot enchanted arrows which make their armies of dead sisters rise and attack when they spill the blood of an enemy.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> *points up there* That means they&#8217;re bad so <em>watch out</em>.<br />
Well, first of all melee combat is tricky... yeah, for freaking once, it is.<br />
If you don&#8217;t have a good run/walk speed, they&#8217;ll simply run away from you and will possibly end up leading you into more mobs. <br />
Also standing still fighting them isn&#8217;t the best idea ever, since if you&#8217;re in a wide open area, Ambush will add more arrows to the swarm. Ambush arrows don&#8217;t pierce, so get behind of a wall/tree/something to avoid them.<br />
Ranged characters won&#8217;t find an easy prey in them anyway, they won&#8217;t have the problem of having to chase them, but they&#8217;ll have to deal with their high damage more often due to their low defense.<br />
While dodging the arrows and shooting at them is doable, drinking a pot or two while you range them from behind a tree (to avoid Ambush) is much less stressing. Just be careful that other mobs don&#8217;t drop by so that your trusted pot won&#8217;t start lacking healing speed :twisted:. <br />
Obviously if you&#8217;re on low health <strong>move</strong> before the lethal wave hits you.<br />
For summoners... well, hide behind a wall and keep on resummoning over and over.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> So they actually are somebody&#8217;s children? Well, I had suposed they just coagulated in some sewer out there.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> It&#8217;s easy for ranged characters to outrun their attacks, and also melee fighters only have to get away when one of their rare succesful hits happens to proc Cloudkill. Yeah, once in every 40 enemy swings you have to move 10 yards away. Omg they are impossible to kill.</p>

<p>However, our dear (not Druid) summoner crowd might find a hard foe in them. Mainly because Cloudkill + swarm of minions = dead minions. I reccomend letting them die and fighting them yourself. It&#8217;s a bit less stylish, but you&#8217;ll end much faster than TPing back to town, resummoning and coming back.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The life of this duckling has always been sad, not only he was morphed into some snakey being by the demonic taint, but on top it&#8217;s whispered that the spirits of several virtual fishermen have possesed him recently. That might explain his incessant chatter about how cool fishing is, his explanations about how to reel, the best places to try and fish and his attempts to give a fishing rod to any hero in his sight.

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> When you&#8217;re fighting (in melee) melee monsters in a place were you might find monsters that charge, it&#8217;s always reccomended to put your back against a wall, for that will stop them from charging multiple times and chopping you down.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Direct descendants of the legendary Asuka Langsley, these insane priests inherited from her their ability of setting people&#8217;s arms on fire from a distance. Later, after they sold their souls to the Three, that power was extensively revised and added a direct damage/range synergy from vit.<br />
 <span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> &#8220;Lulz, np! I finally gave a try to those resistances you continuosly spam about and now I actually don&#8217;t die at angry poison sputters anymore! :D Deathless will die in no time!&#8221;<br />
Great, but the thing is that now Hell has gone a step further by granting these fallen priests an evasive AI as well as the powerful Angelfire spell.<br />
This means that now they won&#8217;t run to slap you in melee (at least, not usually), they&#8217;ll &#8220;just&#8221; cast massive Angelfires that will stack on each other from a half of a screen away while you swat away with melee monsters.<br />
And yeah, I said &#8220;stack&#8221;, because since the spell has no ND the whole pack can perfectly range you with it dealing full damage (packs bring about 4-5 monsters).<br />
Here Sing_In_Silence&#8217;s MDR tactic would be the most useful to melee characters, for it would allow them to stand still in the flames without actually taking any damage (with about 80 MDR). <br />
Of course, I won&#8217;t be such a fool to think that <em>anyone</em> is going to change his gear just in case he/she comes across these monsters, but it was worth noting as it&#8217;s a very interesting idea, and because... you know, it <em>actually</em> works.</p>

<p>However, basic tips I can provide are moving and not letting any other monster lock you in melee, for it might leave you vulnerable against their burning onslaughter.<br />
Of course, don&#8217;t dare to kill Succubi when you&#8217;re fighting a Deathless pack.</p>

<p>NOTE: Extra testing has proven that they do still run towards you sometimes... Well&#8230; if the do rush to you, they won&#8217;t cast, and their melee damage is ridiculous.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> I doubt there&#8217;s any missile the moves slower than VS, really, it&#8217;s a sin to get hit by it.<br />
However, it&#8217;s true that if some of these mummies appear when you&#8217;re locked in melee combat, not even your maxed poison resist will help you. In order to avoid that, don&#8217;t rush crazily into mob packs without knowing what might be nearby.<br />
If you get killed by VS with a ranged character, I&#8217;ll find out where you live and send you a mail bomb.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, Flamefront looks awesome, but in fact it deals kinda low damage with maxed resistances. Still, they move pretty fast and can range you with FF from almost offscreen, so watch out, a pack of them could snipe you with it while you fight other mobs, making your life a lot harder.<br />
Also their direct damage is very decent, not bonecrusher, but it surpasses many other melee mobs.<br />
Basically this is a balanced, not one hit killer elite (those almost don&#8217;t exist anymore). Not a challenge, but neither ignorable at all.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The fact that these mummies are more prepared for melee combat than they are for spellcasting is another pillar on which the theory of the so-called Vizjerei &#8220;Mage Clan&#8221; been the cover for a group of ancient wrestlers maintains.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Unworthy of their &#8220;ELITE&#8221; title, the only threat that can come from these monsters is that you ROTFL for too long after killing them, which might leave you vulnerable to other attacks.<br />
Really, regular mummies have a chance to headshot you with VS if they attack you when you can&#8217;t move, but these &#8220;elite&#8221; versions don&#8217;t.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Dodging Ice Beam in piece of a cake, and still letting it hit you won&#8217;t cause any problem due to it&#8217;s major lack of damage against your maxed resistance.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> When a gyrocopter army of death lost control and crashed in Mount Arreat, their pieces scattered all across the snowy field. Then, when Baal rised his army of Ice Beasts, he noticed to his surprise that the ones which contained a part of the gyros&#8217; batteries had the power to cast lightning beams. As a tribute to the flying machines he also granted them the power of laughing out loud when attacking.<br />
<em>ROFLCOPTER!!!!!!</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Mind Flay&#8217;s damage won&#8217;t be your worst problem, since the ND will protect you from multihits even if several hit you at a time and your maxed lightning resistance will do it&#8217;s thing, reducing the damage to slightly above zero.<br />
However, their melee attack is noticeable and their AR pretty high, making life harder for ranged characters with low defense. Drop a Bane Monster or two next to them to tank the lightnings while you snipe them from safety.<br />
If you don&#8217;t like summoning, you can always keep moving to avoid them, but remember that they&#8217;re likely to hit you and that being slowed is very bad for you.<br />
Melee characters don&#8217;t have any real problem against them.<br />
@Summoners: Mind Flay has a splash effect on striking, meaning that they&#8217;ll hit many of your minons with every beam, and your minions are pretty vulnerable to elemental damage. However, they are not SO dangerous.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Don&#8217;t let the red flames of apocalypse fool you, these guys are so shy that they will AI lock in direct melee combat. <br />
Also, in case you want to beat them without cheesing for some odd reason, Magic Missiles deal major unresistable damage, but they can be avoided by moving just a bit when they target you, Apocalypse sucks after getting crippled by your fire resistance so no big deal.<br />
As always, on the other side of the coin we have summoners, on top cold sorcs, whose minions will get INSANE damage from Apocalypse.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, as with other Gargoyles, getting melee locked =dead meat.<br />
So yeah, you have to move once you see that soon-to-be-obliterated-white-mark-thing on the ground, the other choice is praying that none of their 20 rocks will hit you, and that you&#8217;ll survive to the 3x damage each of them does.<br />
Ranged characters have to avoid melee combat at all costs, nothing new for them.<br />
Also, even though less important, their melee attack itself deals decent damage.<br />
And another thing, &#8220;on attack&#8221; procs such as SoR will &#8220;chase&#8221; you. This means that if a monster starts swinging at you and you move away, when the monster procs his on attack skill it will fall right on your head, no matter if you&#8217;re already miles away.<br />
This is most noticeable if you&#8217;re playing an amazon, due to Defensive Harmony and her fast walk/run speed. <br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span>  Since Inarius created <em>her</em>, the Worldstone has always had a will of her own and will not allow anyone to stop her from accomplishing her duty. If neccesary, she will even call forth the spirits of the very nephalem to destroy whoever dares to rise against the Angel&#8217;s will.<br />
Unfortunately, Baal&#8217;s great demonic knowledge together with the moment of weakness that follows such a powerful summoning rite, allowed him to corrupt the ghostly apparitions and side them with Hell&#8217;s forces.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, basically, don&#8217;t let him touch you at all unless you&#8217;re a big bad tank. Really, they are VERY likely to cut you by the half with a single axe swing.<br />
Of course, their Charge damage is just insane and <strong>must</strong> be avoided. A problem might be that they move at the same speed when they walk and when they charge, if you really don&#8217;t know what to do as a melee character, drop a lolsummon at their feet so that they stop to headshot it. Then you can proceed to kill them as anything else, for you&#8217;ll have time to move to melee range (while they kill the lolsummon) and they won&#8217;t be able to charge.<br />
For rangers, the solution is exploiting their lack of speed, they move slow, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to keep distances and snipe them with your random flurry of arrows/spells.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> As a melee character, you&#8217;ll find yourself that your option to retreat (which you never use) is takes away. Meh, be how it be, you&#8217;ll do with these angelic demons  the same you do with any other kind of melee monster. Your high damage/life leech/defense will serve you well.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s nothing better for characters with low defense rating than a melee monster who instantly teleports right on them and then cages them, forcing them to tank or die.<br />
Let&#8217;s do our best so that you avoid the latter option. <br />
First of all, smash the potion button as soon as you see them appearing, having a teleport source is still kind of useless against them, since they&#8217;ll just pounce on you again, caging you for a second time.<br />
Sadly, there&#8217;s no other option than facing them in melee until the Bone Prisons break, which by the way your AoE attack should do in no time.<br />
Then run away a little (not too much or they&#8217;ll pounce again) and smackazor them with your ranged pwnage.</ul><br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not only they hit hard and move fast, but they come in 4-5 monsters packs and their Thunderslam allows them to control a crowd of summoned minions perfectly. Even though it will take them some time to actually kill them all, so take the time of protection until your minions die to cast your destructive magicks on them. The only summoner which doesn&#8217;t have a direct damage spell in his tree is the Necro, but he has totems, which can&#8217;t be stunned. So simply cast sacrifices and summon a few of them, keeping them alive with Unholy Prayer then. Another choice is having  a crossbow and using your 1337 skills to obliterate them.<br />
For melee characters there isn&#8217;t too much problem with them, they won&#8217;t cast Tslam often enough to stunlock you and even if they do, your high defense rating will perfectly protect you from it.<br />
Rangers might prefer dropping a lolsummon to stop them and then using all of their dumb firepower to annihilate them, since outrunning them can be complicated (for non-amazon characters).</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well... It sucks, but I have to admit these guys pose a threat.<br />
Basically, their melee damage is VERY high and their AR is impresive too, this makes them already bad for low defense characters. But on top, their Fortress can be lethal due to the eight arrows per second is shoots. Standing still fighting them without good defense rating and decent HP regenerating skills will possibly make you get maimed.<br />
But there&#8217;s a good part, they move kind of slow, so unless other monsters lock you in melee, they shouldn&#8217;t be able of catching ranged characters. Keep moving.<br />
Summoners won&#8217;t find a particulary hard foe in them, for Fortress will simply hit some their monsters, without even killing them. And not even their melee damage will make it against a zerg rush, since Summoned minions usually have a nicely high HP.</ul></p>

Now all you have to worry is LW, which can actually deal high damage despite of your maxed resistances. Also dodging it isn&#8217;t exactly easy, since he&#8217;ll cast it on your head and you&#8217;ll get hit no matter how fast you run.<br />
Melee characters should rush at him without caring about anything else, potting to tank the LWs.<br />
Potting should be the perfect solution for ranged characters too, maybe dropping a lolsummon (Bane Monster wins this time) by his side so that not all of the heat focuses on them.<br />
Summoners won&#8217;t have any problem with them, for LW won&#8217;t really kill their mobs, at least not instantly, which is the only thing that stops a summoner.</ul></p>

Yes, you noob, they die in one pathethic hit from any kind of summoned monster (Edyrems included) and even if you range them with regular attack and a T1 bent short bow they&#8217;ll die in 1 hit ANYWAY. <br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Drop a Bane Monster lolsummon in front of them unless you have fight them in mele. You might wonder why, though. Basically because LW deals a lot of damage even with supermaxed resistances, and dodging it isn&#8217;t as easy as it seems. It&#8217;s doable if you have a lot of space, but the Halls of Vaught aren&#8217;t exactly a wide open area.<br />
Also another fact that difficults dodging them is the fact of packs having 4-6 monsters. So drop the damned immune to Lightning monster a bit away from them and range them without any problem.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Watch out! Their Broadside is likely to lock you in hit recovery if it catches you without good defense, and that will make you unable to dodge the spines.<br />
Still, if you don&#8217;t let it touch you, you won&#8217;t have a real problem, and it&#8217;s fairly easy to avoid it by running around and geting away every now and then. Sniping them is however the best solution for ranged characters.<br />
Summoners have to do their same ol&#8217; trick, simply zerg rushing them until they die.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about our melee pals: Many may simply have no problem when fighting them, since their life leech, high damage and life recovery (from potions) simply outheals the damage from Broadside. Still, for the few not OP melee characters (yes, they exist) I would reccomend either having some &#8220;Stun Target&#8221; MOs applied in their weapon. In case they&#8217;re fighting multiple ones, fast moving and attack speed, enough dive in while the rats are casting Broadside should do the trick.<br />
However melee characters can tank the spine flurry longer than usual, due to their heavy defense. <br />
STILL, I wouldn&#8217;t dance in it.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Fire Cannonade and has a melee heavy physical/fire melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Got sick of being socketed.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Fire Cannonade is mostly eye candy, against your maxed resistance it will deal just some ignorable damage, also it doesn&#8217;t put you in hit recovery, so it won&#8217;t even lock you.<br />
What you have to watch out for is their heavy melee attack and their high AR, which ensure you to get stoned to death if they lock you in melee and you have low defense.<br />
Yet this can be helped by running around hitting every now and then. Yep, evasive tactics ftw.<br />
Summoners won&#8217;t have a real problem with them... or at least non-summonsorcs won&#8217;t, because Ice Elementals + Fire Cannonade = Trouble. You can still pwnazor them yourself, though.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Baal, Vision of Destruction</strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Time Field and Thundergod. Also has a melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> If you think these ones should be in the Boss List as Baal&#8217;s minions, think about it again. They naturally spawn in the Worldstone Chamber, hence they have all the right in the world to be here.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> What you&#8217;ll notice right when you drop in the WC ( :P) is that every single of them runs like a bat out of hell, in fact, in miliseconds you&#8217;ll be locked in melee. However, with some def they&#8217;ll miss almost constantly. Running is futile, so simply use all your firepower and reduce them to tiny bloody fragments.</ul></p>
