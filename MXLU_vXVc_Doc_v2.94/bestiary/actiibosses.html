<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Radament</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Radament (Special Mummy).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Sewers level 3.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Mana burn.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical/poisoned attack. Casts Lightning Wall, casts Static Orb, Curses on damaging (-50% physical resistance), casts allied Fist of the Heavens on death (kills any hostile mob with the undead tag it touches).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> When doctor Frankenstein (senior) lived in Lut Gholein, he always believed that, by using electricity, a dead body could be reanimated back to the living&#8217;s world. So one day he assaulted the city&#8217;s museum and took this ancient mummy with him.<br />
Then he went to his secret underground laboratory and applying the power of lightnings on the mummy&#8217;s heart and brain, he reanimated it. It was a total success.<br />
Of course, what really happened is that while he used those stupid lightnings which obviously didn&#8217;t do anything, the restraining powers of the runes engraved in Radament&#8217;s sarcophagus kept weakening over time. Eventually freeing the demon.<br />
It was just a coincidence that the evil spirit caged inside of the mummy woke up at the same time the lightning fell.<br />
Still, the guy didn&#8217;t listen to any reasoning and just went on bragging for his whole life about how impressive he was and how much he rocked.<br />
It&#8217;s said that he even had a son with the same obsession.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Not exactly minions, but he spawns by the side of ~10 non-immune Quad-elemental Skeletons (melee or casters). It seems to be Radament forces Poison non-elite skelecasters to appear too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Needless to say, Lightning resistance is needed here.<br />
The room where he hides is easily recognizable, so make sure there are no random monsters following you when you get in there.<br />
Now you might want to get rid of his underlings asap, because if you don&#8217;t they could melee lock you, making each Static Orb multihit you for maximum damage. <br />
Even melee characters should do this, because he&#8217;ll curse you as soon as he hits you with <em>anything</em>, meaning you&#8217;ll end up taking 1.5x damage from any nearby melee monster and without the option of fleeing.<br />
When you&#8217;re done with them, he&#8217;ll be pretty easy. Ranged characters can perfectly avoid his Static Orb, and standing still on a LW will cause you to get hit only once. <br />
Melee fighters won&#8217;t have too much problem fighting him, even though they should bring potions and poison resistance to the fight, for he can pack quite a punch in melee and his poison lasts for a veeeeery long time.</p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~7 Undead Vultures.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not really needed, even though that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll be easy to kill. The curse, added to Bloodlust will make them deal close to 2x damage almost all the time. <br />
The best thing to do would be going for the boss, ignoring the others until it dies. Then once the curse fades away they&#8217;ll be just regular Vultures.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Spawns (Adult) Sand Maggots, casts Gamma Field on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;... Are you going to eat that?&#8221; &#8211;Warmaggot the Mad.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Not directly minions, but a random number of Sand Maggot Egg/Young/(Adult) protect Her Obese Highness.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> No real need of strategy, she doesn&#8217;t have any direct damage spell and the monsters she rarely spawns can be easily killed. There&#8217;s one thing you have to do, though. Open a TP right after killing her and go back home for a while.<br />
Her Gamma Field deals an <em>insane</em> amount of damage and lasts for years, you could say that it&#8217;s no big deal, because there are no living enemies in that room anymore and poison can&#8217;t kill you. Well, you&#8217;re somewhat right, but the permanent blazes scattered all over the place will hit you and kill you when you try to pick up the loot with 1 HP.<br />
So TP home, heal and wait for the GF to end, then come back and rob the place.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Looks like Merlin didn&#8217;t like it when she cheated on him with Arty. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~10 Extra Fast Fata Morgana, which teleport you on striking too.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Bleh, no need of a strategy, they won&#8217;t be hard enough to do anything more than slowing you down slightly.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Lord of all frenzied acid beasts, this powerful creature has the ability of channeling all the hatred of demons for the human kind and materializing it into three fearsome sputters of destruction.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~8 Extra Fast Poison sputters.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Come on. The triple shots are cool, but assuming that you have decent poison resistance they won&#8217;t deal any noticeable damage. And however they don&#8217;t have high HP nor anything to make up for their lack of offensive power.<br />
In short, B47.</p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee lightning attack. Casts Flash, also casts Static Trap on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;And so it came to be, that the Infernal power created a creature with the only purpose of  shocking any newcomer, for it had been granted the power of violating the entrance safezones. And they cried.&#8221; &#8211;Tales of Nooblaria.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Extra Fast Red Storms.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Get lightning resist before diving here. Really, get 75% and you won&#8217;t notice Flash damage at all. However you should watch out for the traps they cast on death, they&#8217;ll stun you, making each Flash hit get you into hit recovery, which will hinder you from doing anything at all. Don&#8217;t bring Reanimates here.</p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Time ago, when Mephisto was checking the new undead recruits, looking for a new cold sorcerer chief, he came across this one and without saying anything just cutted his left eye out.<br />
-Mephisto: Are you DEAD? <br />
-Him: AYE!<br />
The Prime Evil bursted into laughters and named him new captain of the Bone Warlocks. The Deadeye motto remained since then.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Bone Warlocks.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, you possibly have noticed this before, but just in case, snowballs can be dodged with your eyes closed. However you should have high cold resistances by now, so getting hit a little won&#8217;t be a big deal.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">The Summoner</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Summoner.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Arcane Sanctuary.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Starfire (lowers elemental resistances by ??/??/39%), Banish (lowers max HP by ??%), Ring of Fire and spawns monsters (only from the Arcane Sanctuary, Elites included). <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> A hopeless soul which was shown the way of darkness by a powerful corrupted mage. From his maddened babbling, only a word could be undertood, crystal clear and filled with eternal hatred: &#8220;Drognan&#8221;.<br />
...Well, that, and &#8220;Whoreson&#8221;.<br />
Now I think about it, that last word was scribbled all over &#8220;Horazon&#8221; in the Journal. :P<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None directly.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, when he sees you (a little before really getting in your screen) he first casts Banish on you and then starts summoning over and over, randomly using Starfire too.<br />
As a ranged character, you might be able of ranging him right when he starts casting on you, mostly if you have autotargeting skills. Even though that&#8217;s pretty boring (and dangerous), it&#8217;s more reccomended to quickly rush close to him so that he wastes more time using Ring of Fire and Starfire than summoning. <br />
Melee characters simply have to rush to him before they get melee locked and stabbing him continuously until he drops. Sounds brainless, I know *shrugs*.<br />
As a summoner, what you could do is rushing as close as you can before getting locked, then TPing home and coming back with your army properly buffed to slaughter him.</p>

<p>Remember that the continuous flux of monsters can be a pretty interesting source of quick exp and items, not the best one, but pretty profitable.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> I have to organize this one, he does too much &#8220;strange stuff&#8221;.</p>

<p>-Heavy melee stunning physical attack, chance to cast Shower of Rocks (reduces physical resistance by ??/??/45%) and Fortress.</p>

<p>-Charge, ignores your avoidance but needs a running start.</p>

<p>-Exorcism, melee attack that deals heavy Magic DoT and spreads from enemy to enemy. BUT, it only damages you if you&#8217;re standing still, you won&#8217;t lose a bit of hp if you&#8217;re walking around. On the other hand, it&#8217;s the only DoT that can kill you.<br />
It&#8217;s <em>Crank! Crank, I tell you!</em></p>

<p>-Warp Field aura, which, from what tests tell, doesn&#8217;t actually lower your phys. resistance, even though it slows everything affected and keeps your monsters from healing.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>The Horadrim, right after listening to the words of the Angel and dooming Tal Rasha to an eternity of pain and madness, noticed that the pet of the great mage, a little scorpion he called Leirud, looked pretty blue.<br />
One of the mages, sharing the sadness of the little creature, returned two days later through a secret passage they had built without the consent of the Angel and began to try and open the gates they had sealed, for some reason obsessed with idea of returning the little guy to his master.<br />
Right when the runic seal was starting to break, the mage felt the cold edge of a blade in his neck, seconds later his head rolled on the floor and Tyrael had already sheated his sword and fixed the seal.<br />
However, Baal&#8217;s whisper of madness had already made it through the slightly shattered part of the seal, and it found a recipient in the little Leirud, who was covered in the powerful blood of the Horadric mage.<br />
In seconds, the scorpion grew and morphed into a wicked hellish creature. Empowered by the Prime Evil&#8217;s wrath, it charged against the Angel and smited him with his full might.<br />
The Angel stood up and, ignoring a battle he could not get anything from, floated out of the monster&#8217;s grasp. Then with one blow made the secret passage crumble and fled, leaving the enraged beast behind, forever caged and forced to guard his former master&#8217;s tomb.</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Nothing. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, Duriel may not pummel your face if you don&#8217;t do something stupid, here it goes the list of stupid things you shouldn&#8217;t do/tips:</p>

<p>-Try your best to get a high defense rating for this fight. If he still has a high chance to hit you, perhaps you could try to get items that slow him. That should really help you, since if you don&#8217;t have too much defense you&#8217;re likely to be a ranged character.<br />
Remember, slow for bosses caps at 50%.</p>

<p>-Almost every class has a source of DoT (poison, duh), don&#8217;t overlook it only because you don&#8217;t usually need it or it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;match your purist build&#8221;, your &#8220;purist build&#8221; is failing here. It needs help. :P<br />
(Hint: If you don&#8217;t have anything in your skill tree, check your &#8220;class only&#8221; low level RWs, there usually are very helpful things there.)</p>

<p>-Don&#8217;t let him charge lock you, you can actually RUN away from his charges, since having 300K defense of zero won&#8217;t matter for it to hit. If you move so slow that you can&#8217;t dodge the charges, rush to a wall and endure the first one, he&#8217;s not smart enough to go back and charge again.</p>

<p>-Exorcism <strong>only damages you if you&#8217;re standing still</strong>, move! Even if you&#8217;re fighting in melee, get away for a bit instead of trying to tank the damage and failing epically.</p>

<p>-Fortress can be <em>terrible</em> if you stand still too. Mainly because if he hit you succesfully when he proc&#8217;d it, you&#8217;ll be stunned and possibly get locked in hit recovery when the arrows get to you. Again, the best solution (other than the obvious &#8220;more def&#8221;) is walking around so that the arrows won&#8217;t get you.</p>

<p>-Shower of Rocks is deadly. Move when you see it proc.</p>

<p>@Summoners: As a summoner, there is little you can do help your monster fight tactically, but if you think you&#8217;re too cool to just resummon them over and over, get your hands on a Pax Mystica Staff. Now when you see a SoR proc, teleport to the opposite side of the room, so that when your minions insta-rush to Duriel they won&#8217;t get under the SoR again. Also moving to the other side of the room when Fortress appears helps to avoid about half of the arrows (because they can&#8217;t be shot as there is no close enough target). Be how it be, there is little or nothing you can do to help them against Exorcism. I&#8217;d TP home and heal in that case.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Flower Prowler</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Acid Beast.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Tal Rasha&#8217;s Chamber (Halls of the Unwary).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Cursed.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical/poisoned attack, Acid Trance aura (self only), Poison sputter. Casts Gift of Inner Fire on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The mages cleansed the chamber of any life form, no matter how small it could be, before chaining their master and the Prime Evil within him. Yet, as time passed, the continuous flux of dark power that emanated from Baal&#8217;s essence started to manipulate the microscopic bacteries themselves. There were many failures, that still crawl through the chamber today looking for a place to die. But the dark evolution process went on, speeding up exponentially as time went by. And eventually, it succeeded.<br />
In the end, even if his brother hadn&#8217;t helped him, these demons-to-be would have grown powerful enough to free the Lord of Destruction and maybe would have become one of Hell&#8217;s greatest creatures, for they had being spawned from Baal&#8217;s will directly.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~9 Acid Beasts. All of them Extra Fast and with Acid Trance (self) aura. Also they cast GoIF on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Well, he&#8217;s basically a trap for those who believe that Duriel is the last thing they have to kill in Act 2. Just rememeber to heal after the battle with the big guy and you won&#8217;t have any problem. Focus on one at a time, AoE attacks will accomplish nothing, since when one of them dies, the others get healed.</ul></p>
