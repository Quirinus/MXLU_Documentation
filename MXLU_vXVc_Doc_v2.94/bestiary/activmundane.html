<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Every dark cloud has a silver lining, but Lightning kills thousands of people who try to find it every year.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"> <strong>Strategy:</strong></span> No big deal, just don&#8217;t stand there with a silly look and you&#8217;ll be ok.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bone Sorcerer</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts single target Frozen Soul.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Belonged to a clan of magicians who decided that not eating for four months would be great to communicate with spirts of the elements. In fact, it technically did work.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> If you really needed to, you could easily dodge the snowballs, but you shouldn&#8217;t have to anyway.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span>Chuckles, crackles and roasts you.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Simple, as long as you don&#8217;t stand still without maxed resistances, you&#8217;ll have no problem.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Cold Beam and Gamma Field.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> As his name says, he likes asking stuff to the darkness.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Cold Beam won&#8217;t be a problem, but Gamma Field will. Keep in mind that even if your poison resistance lets you endure most of the damage, it lasts for a kinda long time, so after killing them it&#8217;s pot time.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Hates God of War. He can never make it throught the second boss.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Beware, crushing blow attacks and Charge can be a deadly combo, ranged characters can possibly kill them before they get close, but melee chars should try to kill them as fast as possible, since getting melee locked by them is very bad. A good way to stop charge locking is getting to somewhere they can&#8217;t KB you, like a wall.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Slow, directional fire stream (fake), fire based attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Used to be everone&#8217;s favourite in the alpha times. But then they lost their Fire Stream spell, and now... they&#8217;re just another elite :(.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> As long as you have maxed fire resistance, you won&#8217;t have any problem; the melee attack hits a little harder than the spell, but with some defense or moving you can avoid it completely. Not a problem *sigh*.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Heretic</strong></span> ELITE </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Using a physical, piercing (it has ND, don&#8217;t panic), weapon based Starburst clone, which we will call... Skullburst! (It shoots five skulls).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Heck! You possibly wouldn&#8217;t have killed them in Act I if you knew they&#8217;d end up like this, eh? <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> In case you have heavy defense, you&#8217;ll avoid/tank (with pots :P) the skulls, so no big deal. But in case you don&#8217;t have so much def, you&#8217;ll have to keep moving to avoid cripples.<br />
Skullburst works the same way Starburst does (this is, targeting you only once), so if you don&#8217;t stop too long in the same place you&#8217;ll avoid most of them.<br />
Their HP might be a little higher than the usual of their zone, but it shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a problem anyway.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Twisted Soul</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Single target snowball.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> It is said that most wannabe modmakers, who were overwhelmed by Median&#8217;s might, live inside these disgusting beings. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Ok kids: If we have a mob with lousy HP, we take into a count the AI locks when next to walls and we also add an extremely avoidable elemental spell, what do we get?</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Corruptor Warlock</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Putrid Orb.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Among other things I won&#8217;t mention (^^), Andy taught him the power to cast lot of her poisoned bolts at a time. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not a real problem, with maxed poison resistance you won&#8217;t really feel the burn. However, they move a little faster than usual and might lure you into a mobs pack if you chase them. Be careful with that, for their damage, added to being melee locked by other monsters might actually wear you down.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts a fiery rocks wave and has a melee fire attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Such a baddass name for such a lame monster ¬¬.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Attacks, casts and moves <strong>very</strong> slow, and on top with maxed fire resistance the damage of the rocks is absolutely pathethic. If there&#8217;s one thing you have to watch out for it&#8217;s their melee attack, it&#8217;s kinda heavy.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Pit Beast</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts poison sputter, melee poisoned attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Insane leaping freako that draws pleasure in spitting at people. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> B47, no excuses this time.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Dark Counselor</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Venomous Spirit, melee poisoned attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> His counsels often are like &#8220;Let&#8217;s kill more kids!&#8221; or &#8220;Why not spreading the Ebola via tainted butterflies?&#8221;. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> &#8220;Whaaah! If I stand still for five seconds until VS hits me I nearly die! Whaah!!&#8221;<br />
-Well, I know it&#8217;s shocking, but you could <em>move</em> so that the extremely slow VS doesn&#8217;t hit you! Also with maxed poisoned resistances it will only kill you if you stand there and let it multihit you.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Dark Magistrate</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Venomous Spirit and has a melee poisoned attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Used to teach majik in Hogwarts until some poison sorcies pwntd him.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Move to avoid the VSs, if you do it then it&#8217;s ez job :P.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"> <span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Hellcat</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Ranged/melee cold attack, casts Mark of the Wild on striking and has Taunting Aura.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Ok, let&#8217;s say it one more time: <strong>You can get it as a reanimated monster, but they won&#8217;t have the aura, period. And it wouldn&#8217;t have worked on monsters, however.</strong> There, you can stop farming BPR now :). <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> First, an explanation of the usually overrated Taunting Aura: It only affects you, so ranged minions/reanimates still kick kitten ass. <br />
The radius is about the half of the screen, so <em>actually</em> it doesn&#8217;t force you to anything else than retreating a little to pwn them with your ranged attacks.<br />
In fact, it doesn&#8217;t even fully lock ranged attacks, since you can still use regular attack with a bow/crossbow to shoot at them. However, this isn&#8217;t really reccomended since you might use up your projectiles. <br />
-So basically, when you run into a pack of Hellcats with a ranged character simply get out of the aura range to use your skills. In case they are faster than you, place a lolsummon (Shredder is perfect for this job) to distract them for the few seconds you need and then range as usual.<br />
For melee characters, the thing is pretty obvious.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Hellcat Priestess</strong></span> ELITE</span> <em>Lolcat.</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cold ranged attack, casts Mark of the Wild on striking and has Taunting Aura.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Said to have a thing for Void Archons, but it might be just a rumor.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Yeah, it says &#8220;Elite&#8221; and they look baddass, right? But on the other hand, you should already have maxed resistances, cold included, so the damage will utterly suck. Really, even despite of procing MotW, they will still deal too low damage per hit, which on top you can dodge with some defense.<br />
Note: If both the regular Hellcats and the Priestesses have the aura... then what the heck is the difference between them?</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Balrog</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Fire Splash on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Blades forged at Hellforge! <em>Because no one understands your demonic needs of setting things on fire better than Hephasto, come to the Hellforge!!</em> <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> If you have some defense and fire resistance you&#8217;ll tank them perfectly, because the only danger comes from the physical hit. If you don&#8217;t have enough defense, you&#8217;re likely to be a ranged character ( :P), so simply range them, in most cases they&#8217;ll die before they get to you.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Guardian</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee fire attack, casts Fire Splash on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Nobody knows what the heck he guards... but hey, that means he&#8217;s doing a great job ;).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> B47, he may look big and bad, but the &#8220;fork in the eye&#8221; method usually fixes that.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Bronze Titan</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Stunning (5 seconds) melee physical attack, has a ? screen Fire Resistance aura that turns affected monsters immune to fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Were created by a mad scientific who decided to put a Brute in a microwave to &#8220;see what happens&#8221;. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Flamestrike them to DEATH!!! ...Not. It&#8217;s pretty simple, if you commonly use fire, use your second element  to obliterate them and stop them from rendering mobs invulnerable. Luring them would be an option too, but it&#8217;s not really needed.<br />
Their actual damage sucks, by the way, so you don&#8217;t really have to worry about that if you want to melee them.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Silver Titan</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Stunning melee physical attack and a ? screen Cold Resistance aura to turn nearby monsters cold immune.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Yo dawg! Yeti priests are back!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Just to taunt you, my dear summonsorc ;). Pummelazor them with your second element and you&#8217;ll be freezing enemies to death  again in no time.<br />
@Melee chars: :lol:</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Gold Titan</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Stunning melee physical attack as well as a ? screen Lightning Resistance aura, which renders monsters within radius immune to Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Lol, this noob maxed a defensive aura! Lolol! Now he&#8217;s all screwed up because he doesn&#8217;t have enough points to max Fanaticism. Lololol!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Does anyone use lightning at all? Why? Lightning isn&#8217;t poison... and poison rocks... :?<br />
Use your second element and you&#8217;ll be ok. <br />
If you&#8217;re a melee character, then congrats! U r da masta bcuz phys dmg ftw! ;)... Just kidding. YOU FAIL!</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Gothi</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Poison.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Wyrd (weapon damage, pierces, ND) and melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Summoned by the Three from the distant ***** of Pokemon vs. Predator, they now will serve Hell until their final breath. (Pokemon vs. Predator thing read somewhere, written by Laz)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Their very polite way of saying &#8220;Hi&#8221; is casting Wyrd on you from offscreen, but then they&#8217;ll cast it just every now and then. However, their damage isn&#8217;t too outstanding and it doesn&#8217;t make up for their lame attack and walk speed. <br />
On top, you can avoid it with defense... so yeah, they won&#8217;t be too tough.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Mutilator</strong></span> ELITE</span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee heavy physical attack, also shoots a wave of piercing (with ND) physical damage orbs (It spreads the same way as Arcane Torrent).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;Nobody likes me, so they can all just die!&#8221; &#8211;Ikari Shinji. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Defense is the deity you have to adore to tank them, all of their attacks are weapon based, so it&#8217;s a major help. However, moving and shooting around every now and then does the trick perfectly for ranged characters.<br />
Just a note for summoners, their missiles pierce, so if you think your swarm of minions will protect you from harm as usual you&#8217;re wrong, move around or face mutilation!</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Chaos Caster</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Slayer Bolt (heavy magic damage) and melee physical attack. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Also known as Fingermages or Stormcasters... or &#8220;Boo-hoo! Dey jus pwt me!!!&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> &#8220;Meh, this is no elite I dun have to care about it!&#8221; [YOU HAVE DIED]<br />
-...It happens all the time, but it doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t suck anyway :P.<br />
However, what just chopped 2K of your life off in one hit was their slow moving Slayer Bolt, avoid it from now on and you&#8217;ll be ok. Melee characters don&#8217;t really have any problem because they won&#8217;t cast in melee range.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Soul Flayer</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Slayer Bolt and has a physical melee attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> It lived in Kurast&#8217;s jungle... but that was when it was <em>alive</em>, y&#8217;know.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Avoid the bolts by moving and, when fighting packs, consider them very dangerous and eliminate them asap. The physical damage is important too, but defense helps with it, so no real problem for melee characters.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Incarnation</strong> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Cast Slayer Bolts and has a melee physical attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Shouldn&#8217;t a mob called &#8220;Incarnation&#8221; actually have less ghostly look?<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Dodge the bolts and proceed to smack him whichever way you prefer.</ul></p>

<p><span style="color: yellow;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"> <strong>Void Archon</strong></span> ELITE </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee Area of Effect physical attack, has Warp Field aura that pierces physical resistance by ??/??/80% and prevents your summoned / reanimated monsters from healing. Also blinds enemies on striking and has 75% Physical damage reduction.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> *insert maniac laughter here* All those VAs you wrongly used Soulshatter on are here... Waiting for you... :twisted:<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> VAs are, fairly, some of the most badass elite monsters. <br />
Not only they are a threat by themselves, but the weakening effect nearly doubles any physical damage, which won&#8217;t exactly help you survive.<br />
The best solution is luring them away from crowds, you won&#8217;t have too much problem doing it, because they can fly across any obstacle and are pretty fast when it comes to chase you.<br />
Then killing them shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;too hard&#8221;, as long as you have some defense to withstand their high AR, or you keep moving so that they won&#8217;t cripple you.<br />
@Summoners: This kind of monster can wipe a half of your army with two hits, so either TP home and swarm them a few times or use your active skills and try to do it by yourself for once.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> One of the many trusted warriors of hell... Being the &#8220;many&#8221; the key word, since the only hope of the Three when they deployed them was to get some time to make more elites.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Unleash your inner anarchist! Chaos rulz!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Maybe casting Zen Bolt with a ShadowBeast morph would actually be profitable, but there is just no way it helps these guys.<br />
I mean, it might protect them from one blow... the next 427 will still hit them and kill them. Also the magic damage of the bolts themselves is laughable. Not a hard opponent.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Zen Bolt&#8217;s direct magic damage is kinda low and I&#8217;d say that almost ignorable, problems might come from the snowballs Soulstorm hurls at you, they are likely to stack and end up dealing some decent damage, but there are a few things to take into a cound about it:<br />
They cast Soulstorm right on your head, meaning that no matter if they actually cast 679 on you, unless you move they won&#8217;t be able of targeting you, and therefore won&#8217;t deal any damage. But be aware that if you <strong>do move</strong> they&#8217;ll start shooting at you, dealing heavy damage (if a bunch of them are stacked) despite of your resistance.<br />
But as long as you move a little, you shouldn&#8217;t have any problem with them.</ul><br />
(Thanks to BrotherLaz for the clarification on the way Soulstorm works, because trust me... it was VERY wrong.)</p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> There&#8217;s something very interesting with their Bloodstorms, they cast them <em>right on you</em>, so actually the spell can either shoot to your allies, missing you, or it can simply stay there, gleaming but without shooting at you at all. Unless you move you won&#8217;t take any damage from it.<br />
That said, you already have shiny maxed resistances, so no real problem.<br />
And you can aways use any kind of walls/obstacles to protect you from the missiles.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Doom! ( wtf?)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Getting in their melee range stops them from casting/being invulnerable, and the damage can be withstood without too much effort. Not a hard elite. (I shed a tear every time I write things like that)</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Zen Bolt (pierces, ND magic damage) and Zen Omni Lightning  Bolt . Both turn him invulnerable to elements for two seconds after casting. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Learnt most of his magicks when he dared to raise a metal club to the sky in a stormy night.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> If you depend on elements to deal damage, you don&#8217;t like the fact he turns invulnerable to them. You can either hit him once in melee and then casting (since he&#8217;ll be in hit recovery and won&#8217;t cast, breaking the immunity shield) to pwn him or hang around until the immunity goes off by itself. Usually this last &#8220;tactic&#8221; consists on casting on his head even despite of the immunity and taking his few frames of weakness to slay him.<br />
Note: He&#8217;s actually the leader of a pack of Armageddon Knights and always spawns with them.</ul></p>

<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>The garbageman caaaan! &#8217;Cause he&#8217;s a Homer Simpson&#8217;s maaan!</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> This is an invisible enemy with a heavy melee attack, that would be already bad, but in fact, this invisible enemy likes to sneak behind of you to eat corpses and then spitting slow but absolutely lethal (if you stand still in the fire trail) Molten Boulders at you.<br />
The best thing to do is luring all other mobs away, because they don&#8217;t usually follow you. Or you can kill them first, but this is kinda harder because of AoE attacks being counterproductive, since they may provide them corpses to cast MB... but well, if you are some kind of odd strange player who <em>moves</em> out of the way of slow deadly  projectiles, you shouldn&#8217;t have too much problem anyway.</p>

<p>NOTE: I personally find this a very interesting information, on top if you&#8217;re going to QQ because one of these just killed you:<br />
Back in the alpha, they spitted a fire missile just like their lesser brothers, which made them actually worth of the title Elite, they were tough and they could kill you pretty easily. But there&#8217;s more, there was a dark time in which they didn&#8217;t &#8220;just&#8221; spit a single bolt, they freaking casted freaking CATACLYSM.<br />
Freaking, eh?</ul></p>

Another noteworthy thing is the extreme range of Mind Flay, it&#8217;s about a screen and a half.</ul></p>
