<p>Now, I tend to avoid the use of abreviations to make things more comprehensible. But I also have the bad habit of sleeping, so I did use them. A lot of times:</p>

<p><a href="../abbreviations.html" target="_self"><strong>Acronyms, Concepts and Build-names</strong> of Median XL, by Sing_In_Silence</a> <- This, my dear reader, explains the meaning every single strange thing I say, like &#8220;mob&#8221; or ND.</p>

<p>Also extremely helpful, even though admitedly less related, are <a href="../lfaq.html" target="_self">the <strong>Less Frequently Asked Questions</strong>, by Sing_In_Silence too.</a></p>

<p>-Several rigorous scientific studies have proven that the levels of win of an average subject increase almost exponentially while thoroughly reading the LFAQ-</p>
