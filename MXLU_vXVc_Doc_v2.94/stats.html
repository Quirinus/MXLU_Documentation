<p class="genbig">Concept: WDM</p>

	<p class="content">WDM is short for 'Weapon Damage Modifier'. It refers to attacks/skills (melee and missile) whose damage depends on the damage of the equipped weapon (even if the damage is converted to another element). Those attacks have a chance to hit roll. Spells are not WDM because their damage does not depend on the equipped weapon damage (they do not trigger a chance to hit roll).</p>
	
	<p class="content">For example, the Paladin Vessel of Judgement spell creates missiles that do physical damage, but it does not depend on the damage of the equipped weapon, so it is not a WDM skill and does not have a chance to hit roll.<br />On the other hand, Barbarian's Stormblast melee skill creates missiles that do 1/2 damage that a normal melee attack does (so it's a WDM skill).
	
	<p class="content">Note that a melee skill still always hits with a normal melee attack (some rare skills modify it) if it creates missiles. Ie. the original melee attack is the trigger for creating the missiles. This confusion might arise with some skill that only list the modifiers for the missiles created with the attack and don't list any modifiers for the original melee attack - eg. Stormblast, again.</p>
