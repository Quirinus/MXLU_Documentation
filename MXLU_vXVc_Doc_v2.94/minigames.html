	<p class="content">Minigames are small challenges you can do in Terror and/or Destruction difficulty. The reward for all of these is the same: the maximum amount of points you can put into your skills is raised by 1 for each completed minigame. This bonus is applied to the <span class="unique">Class Charm</span> you picked up in Kurast 3000 BA.</p>
	
	<div class="imabox">
		<p class="content"><b>You need your Class Charm</b><br />
			This challenge requires you to have your <span class="unique">Class Charm</span>. This is a charm that
			drops in the Kurast 3000 BA uberlevel. If you did the Ennead Challenge, you already
			have one.</p>
		<p class="content">If not, see <a href="levelubers.html#k3k" target="_self">THIS PAGE</a> for more information
			about Kurast 3000 BA.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Killing a Boss</b><br />
			This challenge requires you to 'kill' a boss. This means that you need to be
			physically present at the battle <u>and near the boss when it dies</u> before
			you can use the cube recipe that grants you the reward.</p>
		<p class="content">If you succeed in killing the target monster, you get a whirling red overlay
			that looks like three rotating bolts:</p>
				<p><img class="info" src="images/highlights/doc_swirlies.jpg" /></br></p>
		<p class="content">You now have 30 seconds to perform the cube recipe. If you are too slow
			and the red overlay vanishes, you have to do it again!</p>
		<p class="content"><b>Warning:</b> This does not work if the monster is killed by
			reflected damage, due to a Diablo II engine limitation. Please use different means
			of killing the target.</p>

Inch as close as you dare to a witch without waking her up... there is a chance that you will see an unmistakeable star effect <i>just</i> before you get close enough to get eaten by the witch.</p>
	<p class="content">This only works on <b>15%</b> of the witches - if you see no stars, run away before the witch pounces! Cube your <span class="unique">Class Charm</span> with a <b>Thul</b> rune while the overlay is on you to receive a bonus.</p>

Each kill brings a 1% chance to gain a red swirly overlay, so you may have to let him summon a few. Cube your class charm with a <b>Lem</b> rune while the swirls are active to receive a bonus. You have 30 seconds before the swirls vanish.</p>
