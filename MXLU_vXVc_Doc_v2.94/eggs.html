	<p class="content">You might see these conspicuous eggs in low level areas. Kill them and the Baalspawn dragon will hatch. Killing this dragon brings great rewards... if you can kill it, that is.</p>
	<p class="content">For now, the eggs seem to appear only in the Eastern parts of the world, but druids have discovered that	they are carried by underground magma currents and may well spread globally in the future... some even say they can be summoned.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Killing a Boss</b><br />
			This challenge requires you to 'kill' a boss. This means that you need to be
			physically present at the battle <u>and near the boss when it dies</u> before
			you can use the cube recipe that grants you the reward.</p>
		<p class="content">If you succeed in killing the target monster, you get a whirling red overlay
			that looks like three rotating bolts:</p>
				<p><img class="info" src="images/highlights/doc_swirlies.jpg" /></br></p>
		<p class="content">You now have 30 seconds to perform the cube recipe. If you are too slow
			and the red overlay vanishes, you have to do it again!</p>
		<p class="content"><b>Warning:</b> This does not work if the monster is killed by
			reflected damage, due to a Diablo II engine limitation. Please use different means
			of killing the target.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p class="content"><b>Your reward is a cube recipe</b><br />
		After you kill a dragon, you have 30 seconds to freely perform a cube recipe. These recipes
		are repeatable during this window of opportunity, so practice your button mashing skills!</p>
