	<p class="content">The Black Road challenge is the hardest challenge in Median XL. It consists of five trials, ranging from easy to very difficult.</p>
	<div class="imabox">
		<p class="content"><b>Killing a Boss</b><br />
			This challenge requires you to 'kill' a boss. This means that you need to be
			physically present at the battle <u>and near the boss when it dies</u> before
			you can use the cube recipe that grants you the reward.</p>
		<p class="content">If you succeed in killing the target monster, this overlay appears:</p>
				<p><img class="info" src="images/highlights/doc_swirlies.jpg" /></br></p>
		<p class="content">You now have 30 seconds to perform the cube recipe. If you are too slow
			and the red overlay goes away, you have to do it again!</p>
		<p class="content"><i><b>Warning!</b> This does not work if the monster is killed by
			reflected damage, due to a Diablo II engine limitation. Please use different means
			of killing the target.</i></p>
	</div>

	<div class="imabox">
		<p class="content"><b>You need your Class Charm</b><br />
			This challenge requires you to have your <span class="unique">Class Charm</span>. This is a charm that
			drops in the Kurast 3000 BA uberlevel. If you did the Ennead Challenge, you already
			have one.</p>
		<p class="content">If not, see <a href="levelubers.html#k3k" target="_self">THIS PAGE</a> for more information
			about Kurast 3000 BA.</p>

	<hr />
	<p class="genbig">THE FIVE TRIALS</b></span></p>
	<p class="content">It is said that the demon Kabraxis rewards his followers with infernal
		powers: the ability to heal, cast apocalyptic spells or fight like no mere human ever could.</p>
	<p class="content">To obtain Kabraxis' favour, you will need to pass his tests of faith first. These
		tests are based on the human weaknesses Kabraxis exploits to corrupt mortals.
		Thankfully, you are well above being corrupted... right?</p>
	<p class="content">The Black Road Challenge consists of five parts. You can do them in any order, but you
		need to do all of them if you want the reward.</p>
	<hr />
	<p id="fear"><img class="art2" src="images/interfaceicons/blackroad_butcher.gif"/></br></p>
	<p class="content"><b>1. Trial of Fear</b><br />
		Overcome your fear of demons by tackling the Butcher in Terror
		difficulty. Go to The Hole Level 2 and summon him, then kill him. Cube
		the charm while the red swirls are on your character.</p>
	<p class="content">See <a href="summoningubers.html#butcher" target="_self">THIS PAGE</a> for more information on the Butcher.</p>

	<p id="greed"><img class="art2" src="images/interfaceicons/blackroad_gold.gif"/></br></p>
	<p class="content"><b>2. Trial of Greed</b><br />
		Material wealth is a sign of demonic corruption. To pass this trial, keep 666,666 gold or more on your character (not your stash), then use the recipe to complete the trial.</p>

	<p class="content"><b>3. Trial of Contrition</b><br />
		Kabraxis is almost impressed with your combat prowess against demons. But how about
		other humans? To complete this Trial, summon and kill Shaman King Koth
		on Terror difficulty. Cube the charm while the red swirls are on your character.</p>
	<p class="content">See <a href="summoningubers.html#arreat" target="_self">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about King Koth.</p>

	<p class="content"><b>4. Trial of Knowledge</b><br />
		Obtain untold wisdom by collecting the positronic brains of the five Robot
		Bosses in Fauztinville in Terror difficulty. Kill the Robot Bosses and snap
		up their Brains.</p>
	<p class="content">See <a href="levelubers.html#fauzt" target="_self">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about Fauztinville.</p>

		</div>
	</p>
	<p class="content"><i>Fauztinville is a huge level, and the Robot Bosses are fairly well
		hidden. You may need to explore the whole level. One of the bosses requires a
		teleportation ability to access; if you cannot teleport, use an item with
		charges of a teleportation skill, like the runeword Pax Mystica or the
		ubercharm Moon of the Spider. A second boss is at the end of a hidden passage, but can be
		accessed through teleportation as well.</i></p>

	<p id="blood"><img class="art2" src="images/interfaceicons/blackroad_timered.gif"/></br></p>
	<p class="content"><b>5. Trial of Blood</b><br />
		Kabraxis' element is Fire. Try and sway the Amazon Islands to your
		cause by eliminating the Priestesses of the amazon gods of Ice and Lightning.
		But do it quickly. Kabraxis has no time to waste on bumbling humans like you.</p>
	<p class="content">Your targets are Skovos, Priestess of Karcheus and Lycander,
		Priestess of Zerae. Both can be found in the Tran Athulua uberlevel. Go kill
		them on Terror difficulty.</p>
	<p class="content">The catch is that after you kill either one, you now have only
		30 seconds to kill the other and then cube the charm. The timer starts
		to tick down after your first kill. You can only complete this Trial if you lead
		them to the same area and kill them quickly, one after
		the other.</p>
