<p><h2>WARNING! Some of the information on this page is out of date!</h2></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">Intended to supplement the official <a href="faq.html">FAQ section</a>, this is a compilation of Less-Frequently Frequently Asked Questions and their answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 9px;">Let me know if:<br />
<ul>You have a better source for an answer.<br />
There are any questions that you think should be on here. (Preferably with the answer or link(s) to it :P)<br />
You think that something could use better wording/phrasing/layout. (Again, preferably with a suggestion.)</ul></p>

<p>I've started attributing questions and answers (write-ups, formulas, etc.) to who I got them from (read: name is link where applicable), rather then as part of the 'general thank you' at the bottom.<br />
If I missed you, I apologize. Send me a PM, and I'll 'fix it'.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: green;">A good place to start,</span> would be reading the (plentiful, basic and enormously useful) documentation: <a href="http://docs.median-xl.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Median XL Ultimative Documentation</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.medianxl.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Median XL: Ultimative Forum</strong></a> or in wiki format at <a href="http://www.diablowiki.com/index.php/Median_XL" target="_blank">the Diablofans <strong>Diablowiki</strong></a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: purple;">If you're looking for something more basic - introductory even - and newbie-friendly</span>, check out Trucidation's Median XL wikis:<ul><strong><a href="http://medianxl.wikia.com/wiki/MedianXL_Wiki" target="_blank">on Wikia</a></strong>, or<br />
<strong><a href="http://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Median_XL" target="_blank">on Diii.net's wiki</a></strong></ul></span></p>

<p>The LFAQ <strong>will not</strong> answer the following questions. Reasons included.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What character / build farms the best?</span><br />
A:</strong> Almost always prefaced by the words: "Hi guys, I'm new to the mod.", generally in 'I-can't-be-bothered-to-type' English.<br />
You have no idea how much that **** me off.</p>

<p>Common sense says that before you worry about farming, you play one or two chars, not even necessarily all the way through, just to get an idea of how the game plays.</p>

<p>From experience, you can finish <strong>all</strong> the "normal" game, at level 120, as well as (at bare minimum) all of the 'Easy'-rated uberquests, <strong>without</strong> farming for <em>items or Experience</em>; with just the equipment you find / make, having played on /players 1.</p>

<p>Another thing:<br />
Median XL <em>is not</em> cLoD.<br />
Being a "Diablo pro" will do you little good in MXL.<br />
Some of the best items in the game are rares, or rare-based (read: Crafted items).<br />
Farming with your first character = you have no idea what items you're looking for, and you're <em>guaranteed</em> to overlook some good ones.</p>

<p>...<br />
You <em>still</em> want an answer? Fine. No problem.<br />
<ul>1) Use the 'Search' function.<br />
2) Type 'Best farm*'<br />
3) ???<br />
4) Enjoy your (at the time of this posting) 1539 threads or 4504 posts dealing with the subject.</ul><br />
Now get the hell out of my LFAQ and come back when you're serious. :evil:</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What is the best character / build?</span><br />
A:</strong> The best build is the one that complements your play-style the best.<br />
Really.</p>

<p>Also, no character is *always* better then any other, let alone all others.<br />
Also, no build is *always* better then any other. (Let alone <em>all</em> others.)</p>

<p>Also, "best" is a fashion thing, a.k.a. Flavor of the Month.<br />
What answer you'll get depends on what's in vogue at any given time.<br />
It has nothing, necessarily, to do with which char / build is objectively better.</p>

<p>One of the things I, personally, love most about Median, is that, no matter how you allocate your skills, (almost) any build is "hell viable" as it were.</p>

<p>Just pick your skills, and start playing.</p>

<p>Worst comes to worst; look down. There's a char respec tool (linked in the links section, below).</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Which class / build should I play / is most fun?</span><br />
A:</strong> Fun is subjective.<br />
This question has been asked many many times. 'Search', and you'll probably find a general play-style list.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I'm playing a <Build X>, and I'm getting pwnt by <Monster Y> / can't kill <Monster Z> / am having trouble farming <Area A1> / etc. etc. etc..<br />
How can I make my char better?</span><br />
A:</strong> Too specific a question.<br />
General answers are spread throughout the LFAQ and the MXL Bestiary (on a case to case basis), as well as various previous threads which have already asked the same questions.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What's with all the <span style="color: blue;">blue text</span> I'm seeing people write?</span><br />
A:</strong> Blue is the forum's Official Sarcasm color.<br />
Or, in simple English:<br />
Blue text = poster is being sarcastic.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Where are the best places to level?</span><br />
A:</strong> It is the opinion of the author that, since you can get from level 1 to 120 during the course of a regular /players 1 game, before ever reaching Destruction ubers (<span style="color: blue;">because those are the only ones that count...</span>), there is no need to grind/rush/powerlevel.<br />
Also, the fashionable Exp hotspots change.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Where are the best places to farm [gold, rare, unique, sacred unique, set, runes, UMOs]?</span><br />
A:</strong> Read the Pearl of Wisdom. It lists the biased areas.<br />
Also: <ul>The Countess has a very high chance to drop runes.<br />
Bull Prince Rodeo has an assured MO drop. On top of which, his drop <em>does</em> have a UMO bias. (10% to drop UMO.) (Thanks for the tidbit, Borgin :) )<br />
The Robot bosses in Fauztinville have an assured rune drop.<br />
That said, <em>everyone</em> in Destruction Fauztinville can drop Fauztinville Great Runes. (Taha, Qor, Ghal.)<br />
Likewise, <em>everyone</em> in Destruction Toraja can drop Toraja Great Runes. (Krys, Auhe, Sha'ad.)</ul></ul></p>

Particularly noteworthy (examples) are:</p>

<p>"Cube recipes" wrote:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: olive;">Reroll superior/magic/rare item</span></p>

<p>These recipes reshuffle the modifiers and socket count on a superior, magic or rare item and return an item that is similar to the original, but with different modifiers.</p>

Rare item + Oil of Renewal -> reroll item</span></blockquote></p>

<p>"Cube recipes" wrote:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: olive;">Reroll magic to rare</span></p>

<p>Turn any magical item into a rare item. Note that this will slightly lower the output item level to 85% of the input item level, making the magical modifiers that can spawn on it slightly weaker.</p>

<p><span class="reagent">Magic item + Oil of Enhancement + rune -> reroll item as rare</span></blockquote></p>

<p>"Cube Recipes" wrote:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: olive;">Affix burn recipe</span></p>

<p>This explosive alchemical combination burns all magic off an item, returning it as a basic damaged low quality item. This recipe is useful to prepare an item for a runeword.</p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Skill-related basics</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What is the maximum skill level of the skills in Median?</span><br />
A:</strong> Unlike cLoD, where skills had a limit of 20 points, achievable from level 21 on, in Median, the skill level limit scales with your character.<br />
The first 'tier' skill starts with a natural limit of 2.<br />
All skills increase their limit by 1 point for every 6 character levels.</p>

<p>At character level 120, your natural skill limit will be:<br />
for level 1 skills: 22<br />
for level 6 skills: 21<br />
for level 12 skills: 20<br />
for level 18 skills: 19<br />
for level 24 skills: 18<br />
for Uberskills/Ennead/BRC skills: 7</p>

<p>There are charms and items which can increase the natural skill limit.<br />
The total increase possible from charms, as of Ultimative XI, is +13 (sometimes +12 for Barbarians, if you already have points in Ancient Blood) to max natural skill limit:<br />
Thanks to Siddharth353: http://www.medianxl.com/t3074-max-skill-level

Maximum Skill Level Increased by X:

1. The ladder only amulet Khanduran [gives 1 increased level]
2. Taha Gloves Runeword [gives 1 increased level]
3. 6 x Fire Body Armor Runeword [gives 1 increased level, unless you're a Barbarian with points in Ancient Blood skill]
4. Legacy of blood charm [gives 2 increased level]
5. Crystalline Flame Medallion Toraja upgrade [gives 1 increased level]
6. Ennead challenge [gives 1 increased level]
7. Moon of spiders charm [gives 1 increased level]
8. Mini games crowned, mirror mirror, witch queen [gives 3 increased level]
9. Bremtown upgrade [gives 1 increased level]
10. Laz charm upgrade [token recipe upgrade] [gives 1 increased level]
11. Qor Sorceress Body Armor Runeword [gives 1 increased level, Sorceress Only]

SP Total: 12
SP Total for Barbarians: 11 (12 if you don't have points in Ancient Blood)

Realm Total: 13
Realm Total for Barbarians: 12 (13 if you don't have points in Ancient Blood)</p>

<p>Separate and worth noting are skills/synergies that can increase the skill limit.<br />
These are: Paladin's Holy Melee skills to Lionheart, Light and Shadow to Scourge, the Druid's bow skills to Elfin Weapons, the Amazon's spear skills to Lioness, Necro-attack totems (they give each other +max skill), Ancient Blood to all Barb skills, as well as Shamanic Trance to the Ancestor Spirits and any other Stance to Kraken Stance.</p>

<p><strong>Point of Interest:</strong><br />
Even with +max skill limit synergies, you can't put more than 31 Hard Points into the 7-point-limit skills.<br />
(This is due to the hard coded limit of 'skill Hard Point max = Clvl - Reqlvl'.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What are Hard/Soft points?</span><br />
A:</strong> Hard Points = the points you get from a level up or as a quest reward (Tyrael...).<br />
In MXL you get 134 HP's (119 from level ups + 12 from quest rewards + 4 from the 'Dogma' actboss tokens).<br />
Put those points into a skill, and you are able to get the synergy or self synergy bonus.</p>

<p>Soft Points = Stuff you can get from Items or Charms (+3 to all Skills on an amulet or +1 on a ring etc...).<br />
Self-/Synergies do not benifit from Soft Points.</p>

<p>Skill Level (slvl) = Hard/Base Points + Soft Points<br />
(Writeup by [clueso])</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Do soft points count for Synergies?</span><br />
A:</strong> No. Hard points only.<br />
N.B. Shaman's Path &amp; Greater Manifestations' bonuses, Force of Nature, Bacchanalia &amp; Witchblood's effects and Light &amp; Shadow -> Vessel of Judgement are the exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>(This is because they're all 'dummy passives' and not truly synergies.)</p>

<p>Also, see 'Charges', in the Known Bug section.</ul></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">General basics</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What exactly are the effects of the '/players #' setting?</span><br />
A:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://i509.photobucket.com/albums/s335/SubSuid/Beginner-Guide/Unbenannt.jpg" target="_blank">/Players Setting effects</a></span> chart.<br />
Note: The above is for vanilla cLoD.<br />
'/players #' affects drops less in MXL.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: At what level should I do the Uber Quests?</span><br />
A:</strong> ...<br />
Introduction. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Reading</span>. First line.</p>

<p>Scroll through the Pearl of Wisdom. It has a page with information for each Uber, as well as the recommended level for it.</p>

<p>(Well no, it gives you the monster's level.<br />
But that's a not-bad indicator, depending on your /players and build / gear, of course.<br />
Carpathian_Cookie was kind enough to type and format it. See below.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How many kinds of Signets exist? How do they work?</span><br />
A:</strong> Three of them, and the way of using them is pretty obvious, so please read the ingame description. Alternatively, though, you can put them in your belt to eat them.</p>

<p>Signet of Learning: +1 extra stat point. (500 Signet cap)<br />
Signet of Experience: + (250*clvl) exp.<br />
Signet of Greater Experience: + (750*clvl) exp.<br />
Signet of Skill: +1 skill point. Caps at 3.</p>

<p>(Writeup originally by NexX, updated.)</p>

<p>Note: Only Signets of Learning count against the 500 Signet (of Learning) cap.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I just finished Hatred/Terror, and my Leech stopped working!</span><br />
A:</strong> Normal difficulty has a 1/4 (25% effectiveness) penalty on leech. <br />
In Terror, your leech effectiveness is lowered to just 1/50 (2% effectiveness) penalty.<br />
Destruction then pwns it completely, to 1/100 (1% effectiveness) penalty.<br /></p>

<p>Example: You have 25% life/mana leech.<br />
On the Hatred difficulty you have an effective leech of 25*25% (since there's a 1/4 penalty) = 6.25% effective leech.<br />
On Terror, 25*7.5% = 1.875% effective leech.<br />
On Destruction, 25*2% = 0.375% effective leech.</p>

<p>Median 2008 values (kept for reference (and comparison) purposes):<br />
<span style="font-size: 6px;">There's a 1/5 (20% effectiveness) and 1/40 (2.5% effectiveness) leech effectiveness penalty on Terror/Destruction respectively.<br />
Example: You have 25% life/mana leech.<br />
On the Hatred difficulty you have an effective leech of 25% (since there's no penalty).<br />
On Terror, 25*20% = 5% effective leech.<br />
On Destruction, 25*2.5% = 0.625% effective leech.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What's the base Mana Regeneration rate in MXL?</span><br />
A:</strong> Base mana regen is quadrupled from cLoD.<br />

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">%Gold Find (%GF), %Magic Find (%MF), MO and Socketable basics</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Do Minions/Mercenaries/Reanimates gain your %MF/%GF?</span><br />
A1:</strong> For the most part, yes.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> Minions and Reanimates gain your %MF, Mercs gain your %MF/%GF + any they have on their equipment.<br />
This only counts if they are the ones who land the killing blow, though.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> This does not work in reverse. You want it, you got to wear it.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Does +%MF affect UMOs? Or Runes?</span><br />
A1:</strong> No.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> +%MF increases your chance of finding magic+ quality items.<br />
UMOs however, despite their name, aren't actually a different quality then the regular ones.<br />
Likewise Runes. They aren't of magical+ quality, so %MF has no effect on their chance to drop. That comes only from the % each item-type has to drop in the monster's TC.</p>

<p>The only way to increase your chance of getting them is to use the Area with the appropriate Drop Bias.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I used Mystic Orbs on an item. Now I want to do X/Y/Z to it. Will it keep the MOs?</span><br />
A:</strong> If whatever you're doing says that it will reroll the item, then no. Otherwise yes.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I remove MOs from an item?</span><br />
A:</strong> Not directly.<br />
That said..:<br />
<ul><li> Any cube recipe that rerolls an item will 'remove' the MOs, but it'll have rerolled the item.<br />
 <li> MOs applied to a RW get removed when you unsocket it.<br />
 <li> Otoh, MOs applied to the base item don't.</ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I socketed Gems / Jewels / Runes in an item. Now I want to do X/Y/Z to it. Will it keep them?</span><br />
A:</strong> As above.<br />
Iirc the <strong>only</strong> recipes that will <em>keep</em> the socketables in an item is cubing with an MO, and the 'lucky upgrade'.<br />
UNSOCKET the item first, unless you don't mind losing its socketables.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I make Runewords from Magic/Rare/Crafted/Honorific/unique items?</span><br />
A:</strong> NO.<br />
As the official FAQ says, Non-magical items only.<br />
This means any low quality/normal/superior or non-magical Ethereal/Superior Ethereal items.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Does the 'Stun Attack' modifier on my item work with Skill X?</span><br />
A:</strong> <ul><li> For <em>direct melee</em>: <ul>Stun attack as an item modifier works.<br />
Also - to the best of my knowledge - any buffs that grant Stun length (e.g. Hamstring) will stack with Stun Attack on weapon.</ul><br />
<li> For <em>any kind of ranged attack</em>: <ul>Stun attack as an item modifier <em>does not</em> work.<br />
However, if a ranged skill has Stun, e.g. Blindside, Stampede, Soulshatter, Thunder Slam, etc., its Stun will work as advertised.</ul></ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: There's something screwy going on with my Merc.</span><br />
A:</strong> See Known Bugs section.</p></ul>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Cap-related misc. basics</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What's the cap for:</span></strong><br />
<ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">"Damage reduced by #%"? (a.k.a. %DR, %PDR)</span><br />
A:</strong> 50%.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How does this interact with "% Enemy Damage Reduction"</strong>, as on Hex, Void Archon's Warp Field aura, etc?</span><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Multiplicative.<br />
50% EDR + 50% DR = 25% damage taken.</ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">-% Enemy Resist?</span><br />
A:</strong> Resist cap out at -100%. Anything beyond that is pointless.<br />
(i.e. If a monster has 0% res, you need -100% to reach the limit.<br />
If -50%, another -50% will get you there.<br />
If 99% (i.e. Highest non-immunity possible), you'll need -199% to hit the floor.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Slow(s Enemy)?</span><br />
A:</strong> Against: regular monsters: 95%, Bosses/Players: 50%.<br />
Also, a single source of slow is capped at 90% for monsters.<br />
If you apply the same type of slow twice, the one you applied last is the one that counts.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Where and how does Cold Slow (a.k.a. Chill) fit in?</span><br />
A1:</strong> In Median XL, Chill is always 50% slow, for as long as the Chill lasts.<br />
It stacks with other kinds of slow.<br />
So, for example, 'Void' + cold damage = (40% slows target + 50% chill =) 90% slow, while target's chilled.</ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Absorb &lt;element&gt; #%?</span><br />
A:</strong> 40% for each element.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Poison Length Reduced By?</span><br />
A1:</strong> 75%, but there's supposedly a -100% penalty in Destruction so 175%.<br />
(A by Brother Laz)</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Does poison damage stack?</span><br />
A:</strong> No. The attack with the highest damage per second (DPS) is applied.<br />
That said, the direct poison damage (zero-frame or first-frame poison damage) does stack on top of the DOT.<br />
For more information, see the linked "Poison damage explained" thread.</ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Curse Length Reduction?</span><br />
A1:</strong> 100%, which makes you immune to curses.<br />

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all Curse / Debuff stats are affected by this item modifier.<br />
(e.g. Slow, Death Touch, etc.<br />
To the best of my knowledge, if it isn't healed by the Town Healer / a well, it's unaffected by CLR.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Damage Reduced by #, Magic Damage Reduced by #, # Absorb?</span><br />
A:</strong> None of them are capped.</p></ul>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What is this Damage Cap I keep hearing about?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Excessively simply put, it is a point beyond which you do no damage.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> <a href="http://phrozenkeep.hugelaser.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=8747" target="_blank">Damage Caps, Rollovers, and other #'s</a></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: At what point does damage cap?</span><br />
A1:</strong> {((2 ^ 23) - 1) / 100 =} 83886 damage (per frame where applicable) for each type (Physical, Magic, Fire, Cold, Lightning, Poison) separately.</p>

<p>And it rolls over at 167772.</p>

(Thanks go to aerial for the link / correction.)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br />
If you're reached damage cap (Not mix-element / Poison LCS), report to Brother Laz.<br />
Thank you, and have a good day.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Does the damage cap exist in all versions of Diablo 2?</span><br />
A1:</strong> It exists in all versions 1.09+, except 1.10.<br />
Pre 1.09, idk.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: OMG what happened?! I started a game. My life/mana was filling up, and suddenly it's empty and won't fill!</span><br />
A:</strong> You've managed to gain over 2^15 or 32768 HP/mana.<br />
The visual display rolled over and is showing only the amount over 32768, and you'll see the full orb when you go under that amount.<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12px;">Note however</span></strong>, that although there's no problem here with HP, the client considers you to only have the amount of mana over 32768.<br />
So, if you have 33768 mana, you can only cast spells/skills with a mana cost lower then 1000.</p>

<p>If you drop back under 32768 mana, you will see (and be able to use) your full (current) mana pool.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br />
If you're rolled over your Life or Mana, report to MarcoNecroX.<br />
Thank you, and have a good day.</ul></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">General damage basics</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How does +% Enhanced Weapon Damage work?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Same modifier, different name (in different versions).<br />
TCDamage works like damage bonuses from skills (elfin weapons, lion stance, Shadow Refuge etc) and stats (str and/or dex, depending on weapon).<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> Somewhat simplified:<br />
Final Damage = [Base*ED+Base]*[SkillED+StatED+TCD]+[Base*ED+Base]<br />
where Base=[Min (+ min dmg), Max (+ max dmg)]</p>

<p>TCDef is similar.<br />
Formulas for defense with and without Runemaster respectively.</p>

<p>With Runemaster:<br />
(Total Item Defense+(Dexterity/4))*(R*RMlvl)+Total Item Defense+(Dexterity/4))*(Total Character Defense)+(Total Item Defense+(Dexterity/4)*(R*RMlvl)+Total Item Defense+(Dexterity/4)) -- Assuming Runemaster is applied before TCD.</p>

<p>Without Runemaster:<br />
(Total Item Defense+(Dexterity/4))*Total Character Defense+(Total Item Defense+(Dexterity/4))</p>


<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: So what's the difference between +%ED and +%EWD?</span><br />
A1:</strong> +%ED increases your weapon's base damage, whereas +%EWD increases your *total* physical damage.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> They affect different parts of the damage calculation.<br />
+%ED is part of the first half of the above formula, which is your weapon's base damage.<br />
+%EWD is part of the second half of the formula, which <em>multiplies</em> your total base damage.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: So are +5% EWD Mystic Orbs better than +15% ED Mystic Orbs?</span><br />
A:</strong>As a rule, a low percentile bonus on a large base is more effective then a large percentile bonus on a small base.<br />
e.g. 100 + 5000% = 5,100 <as opposed to> 5000 + 100% = 10,000.</p>

<p>Bottom line: It depends on your base damage. If it's low, +%ED will probably be the better choice.<br />
Once it's high (depending on how high 'high' is), +%EWD becomes the more beneficial.</ul><br />
Note:<br />
There's a post somewhere that gives the exact ratio / numbers, but I don't find it.</p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Dual Wielding</span></em><br />
<ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: When dual wielding, what effects from my boot-side (henceforth 'off-hand') weapon do I get with my glove-side (henceforth 'main') weapon?</span><br />
A:</strong> Depends what skill you're using.<br />
For any <strong>non</strong>-dualwield skill<ul>Not <em>any</em> offensive modifiers - <ul><li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No</span> procs of <strong>any</strong> kind.<br />
Killing with poison spells won't proc them either.<br />
<li> No +%damage, passive damage sources, %EWD.<br />
<li> No Crushing Blow, Deadly Strike</ul><br />
You <strong>will</strong> get any <em>defensive or status</em> modifiers - <ul><li> +skills<br />
<li> +stats<br />
<li> +%Resists, absorb, reduction.</ul></ul><br />
Dual Wield skills (Normal Attack, Blood Hatred, Batstrike, Cautious Strike) swing with both weapons.<br />
So, for any attack with your off-hand weapon, you <em>will</em> get its offensive modifiers.</p>

<p>This list is by no means comprehensive. It's just to give you the idea.<br />
Modifiers will be added as I think of them, after verification.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I stack potions of Healing/Mana? What does this do?</span><br />
A:</strong> Yes, you can. The duration of the potions is added together.<br />
Note: This works with Mercs too.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I stack Elixirs?</span><br />
A:</strong> Yes, but only 1 Elixir can be active at a time.<br />
Drinking another of the same will stack its duration - just like any other potion - but drinking a different one will overwrite the previous one.<br />
Note: This is true of Mercs too.<br />
(Thanks to SKIPPNUTTZ for the correction about Elixir stacking.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What does Next Delay mean?</span><br />
A1:</strong> When hit by an attack/skill with next delay, the target cannot be hit by another ND skill until # frames have passed. <br />

A:</strong> Nothing. It does nothing. It's Flavor Text. Just ignore it.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How does the engine resolve an attack?</span><br />
A:</strong> In this order:<br />
If the attack requires an AR check, roll AR vs Def. Then,<br />
If the attack does Physical damage: % chance to block. Then, {*1}<br />

<p><em><span style="font-size: 13px;" id="item_crafting">Item and Crafting related</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I've tried the 'Lucky Upgrade' recipe 12309874 times already, but it never works!</span><br />
A:</strong> That's because the whether an item is 'Lucky' or not is decided when the item is created. The recipe merely 'reveals' whether it is or isn't.<br />
If the item was created 'Not Lucky', it doesn't matter how many times you try, it'll never work.</p>

<p>Reroll the item, and try again.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: %ED on items is capped at 350%. How do I pass it?</span><br />
A:</strong> For a magic+ quality item: +%ED socketables.<br />
For Runewords: Here's how to get over 350% enhance defense on an item. I'll use Truce as an example.<br />
1) Get the desired base item (Sacred Plated Belt)<br />
2) Make the item Superior<br />
3) Reroll until you get 50% to 60% ED (60% ED)<br />
4) Try Lucky Recipe for another 40% ED (60 + 40 = 100% ED) if fails go back to 3.<br />
5) MO item with 15% ED, X times. The number will be (120 - rw level)/2 in this case that's 120-98 = 22/2 = 11 times (11*15 = 165 + 100 = 265%ed before making the runeword)<br />
6) Make runeword. Aim for the top end ED%, in this case 350, if low unsocket and try again. (265 + 350 = 615% ED) <br />

<p>Note: +%ED/lvl, such as on the 'Dragonheart' RW armor, is additive with %ED, and doesn't count against the 350% ED limit.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Why do you have to MO items before RW'ing them? Doesn't it work if you don't?</span><br />
A:</strong> You have to add the MOs before hitting 350%, else they do nothing.<br />
This is because MO's add to the properties of the base item, and the runeword is in a sense a "second base item". Thus, both the base item and the runeword are capped at 350% ED, so theoretically you could have a 700% ED runeword. Theoretically.<br />
(Note that, at this time, that isn't actually possible, due to rlvl > 120)<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: At what ilvl can the 'indestructible' modifier spawn on a jewel?</span><br />
A:</strong> 21+<br />
(Used to be 21-60, but the upper cap has been removed.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What are the 'Superior quality' bonuses?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Weapons: (20 to 60)% ED, (10 to 150)% AR, (10 to 40)% +max durability. 0-2 modifiers.<br />
Armors:  (20 to 60)% ED, (10 to 40)% +max durability. 0-2 modifiers.</p></ul>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Item Idiosyncrasies</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What? I can't cube my unique jewelry? (Ring of Five, Assur's Bane)</span><br />
A:</strong> Because as far as the engine is concerned, They aren't actually rings{*1}.<br />
(Read: They don't use the 'rin' item-type.)<br />
So Cube recipes that work for 'rin' items won't work with them.</p>

<p>For this reason, you can't use the 'lucky' recipe on them.<br />
'Any item' MOs don't work on them either.</p>

<p>{*1} (They aren't 'rin' so that they drop only in Duncraig, and to assure that Duncraig isn't flooded with unique-rings dropping all the time.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What can / can't I do to ethereal items with the cube?</span><br />
A:</strong> Due to the eth bug, no cube recipe that returns the same item ('useitem') with modified properties will work with ethereals. They've all been disabled.<br />
This means:<br />
* No MOs.<br />
* No <em>lucky</em>.<br />
* No Socket-drill.</p>

<p>Reroll works (but won't return as ethereal).<br />
Unsocket works.<br />
Larzuk can still drill holes in an ethereal item.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Is there a way to choose which unique ring/amulet I'll get from the 'unique creation' recipe?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Sadly, no.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> The problem with jewels, uniques, and rings is that they have multiple overlapping uniques that spawn off those base items. The output of the recipe appears to be at least level 100. As a result anything with a level req of level 100 or below could spawn at random from the unique creation recipe when used on jewels, rings, and amulets.<br /></ul>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Proc / %CtC &amp; oSkill related</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What procs / oSkills can I get?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> See Resource links for a list of oSkills and procs available on prefab items, and a list of oSkills that spawn on magic / rare / crafted items.<br />
Also, Nexus2002's Item Compare Tool (Linked in the Tools section) has a 'modifier search' feature.<br />
Note however, that different procs also exist as random modifiers.<br />
The closest thing to a list of those is Tub's affix list, linked below, which is outdated.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Is there any way in increase the power of procs?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Yes.<br />
A proc is cast as if you are casting the spell/skill at that level.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Will character oSkills benefit from '+ to <class> skills'?</span><br />

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How does +%&lt;element&gt; damage affect the 'added +#-## &lt;element&gt; damage' item modifier? (e.g. Way of the Phoenix grants both bonuses.)</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> <ul>For a direct melee swing, it does just what it says it does.<br />
For a ranged attack of any kind, it does nothing.</ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Is there any way to increase the elemental damage of my attack?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Use attacks with a high Weapon Damage Modifier.<br />
Passive damage sources are multiplied by it, just like any other damage.<br />
Beyond that - <ul>For melee only, +%&lt;element&gt; damage will work.<br />
For both melee <em>and ranged</em>: <ul>1) Adding more +#-## &lt;element&gt; will stack with what you already have.<br />
2) Using the appropriate '-%&lt;element&gt; enemy resist' will increase the damage you do (to non-immunes), but is not accounted for on the LCS.<br />
3) If the elemental damage comes from a skill (Way of the ____, Snake / Kraken Stance, Death's Fury Totem, etc.) +skills will increase the skill level, and so the added damage.</ul></ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What's the difference between the '+Life when struck' and 'Damage reduced by' item modifiers / MOs?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Ranged attacks.<br />
LWS isn't triggered by ranged attacks, whereas DR reduces *all* physical damage.<br />

<p>Note: Like Defensive Harmony, Pact of Blood <em>is</em> triggered by ranged attacks. (Since both use a different modifier then items get.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What modifiers does my attack carry?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> <pre>- Melee attack:

A1:</strong> Despite the item modifier says "Attacker", the truth is that they only work against enemies that successfully strike you in melee and melee only, ranged attackers and casters will be utterly ignored. <br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What do the numbers in "+ Freezes Target/Attacker" and "+ Blinds Target/Attacker" mean?</span><br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What does the "increases Nova Charge scatter radius" item modifier do?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> It means the novas are spawned at a potentially greater distance from the character.</p>

<p>The advantage is that if a nova spawns further away from the monster, you lose a slight bit of damage, but if it spawns closer to the monster, you gain a lot of extra damage, so the net result is positive for monsters further away from the centre.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I use Curse X and Curse Y together? Do they stack?</span><br />
A:</strong> First of all: Differentiate between Auras, Buffs and Curses.<br />
(Different) Auras and buffs stack with themselves, with each other, and with a Curse. (e.g. VA's aura, Hymn, Lionheart and Vindicate will all work together.)<br />
The only question is about Curses.<br />
Second: Slow is not a curse, so no problems there.<br />
Third: afaik there's no list of which curses work together and which don't.<br />
If both graphics appear, then they work together. Otherwise not.</p>

<p>The curses are separated into groups.<br />
Curses in the same group <em>will</em> overwrite each other; will <strong>not</strong> stack.<br />

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What triggers 'on Attack' procs?</span><br />
A:</strong> On Attack triggers every time you swing a melee weapon at an enemy. (Swinging in the air does nothing.)<br />
Bows and throwing skills don't trigger 'on Attack'.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong>Apparently, non-'Normal Attack' skills require a successful AR check.<br />
(Thanks terryys.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What triggers 'on Striking' procs?</span><br />

This includes multi-hits from skills like Retaliate, Wychwind, Faerie Fire, etc.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What triggers 'on Kill' procs?.</span><br />
A:</strong> Weapon carrying attacks or poison attacks that take more than 1 frame to kill their target.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What triggers 'when Struck' procs?</span><br />

A:</strong> Lioness, irrespective of how you get it, disables any ranged skills and spells, only allowing the use of Melee, Buff and Summoning skills.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Hey! I just got Shadow Avatar oskill on my power trip spearzon and she can cast it! Lol! I'm da king now! </span><br />
A:</strong> ... :roll: In any case, you'd be the queen, don't you think? Meh, however. <br />
Yes, that happens and it's not a bug, Shadow Avatar ignores that restriction just like some other special skills do, those are: <br />
Purify, Dark Summoning, Shackles of Ice, Blood Flash and the teleporting skills (Blink, Jitan's Gate, Divine Apparition and Bend the Shadows).</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Protip:</span></strong><br />
If you're using a bow/crossbow and get into that state, you can still use ranged skills by switching to regular attack, which isn't locked. <br />
Why isn't it locked? <br />
Because basic attack switches between being a ranged skill and a melee one depending on your weapon type, this is unfixable there isn't a way to make D2 know when it must lock it out and when it mustn't. <br />
If you're going to profit from this, be careful so that you won't use up your ammo.</ul><br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: My Barbarian Spirits / MO summons / Edyrem (/ Totems) don't follow me!</span><br />
A:</strong> <a href="http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/791/bugfeature.jpg" target="_blank">It's not a Bug, it's a Feature</a>.<br />
Due to an issue with Blizzard's minion AIs, the only AIs that can use more then 1 skill simply don't follow you.<br />

<p>Note:<br />
They <em>will</em> move to engage any enemies they see.<br />
Drag one toward them, and they'll move.</p>

<p>Note:<br />
Once these static (non Totem, duh) summoned creatures engage combat, they have the tendency of going on moving randomly across the screen, even if there is no nearby target. They don't exactly follow you, but they do move a bit.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: My Prowl/Angel of Death don't work!</span><br />
A:</strong> Like cLoD Charge, you need to have a 'running start' to use it.<br />
Trying in melee range will simply do a normal attack, however, any damage enhancement coming from the skill itself (read: AR%, ED%... Anything but the poison damage) will still affect your regular melee swing if you try it in melee range.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Protip:</span></strong><br />
Holding down Alt + Shift will let you Prowl/AoD monsters even in melee range, but they will not work while you have an item namelocked.</p></ul>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How do autotargeting skills work? They instantly start shooting at anything within range, but how do they react to multiple enemies?</span><br />
A:</strong> When an autotargeting skill is activated (e.g. Cascade - on shooting, Lemures - on 'Armed' re-target) it instantly scans the area within it's attack radius from the upper left corner to the lower right one. The first enemy it "sees" is the one chosen as victim and attacked.<br />
However, sometimes the client decides that it should attack something else and shows an aberrant animation which has little or nothing at all to do with what's really going on. Also read next question please. <br />
(Writeup by NexX)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: <Skill X> shows that it's hitting Target Y, but it's actually damaging Target Z!</span><br />
A1:</strong> Engine 'feature' (a.k.a. bug). Unfixable.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> The anims are 'off' because the lightningfury hitfunc desyncs, meaning you hit something else than what the graphic indicates.</p>

<p>This is a D2 engine bug and affects Lemures, Wraith Arrow, Ricochet, Fairy Ring, Lightswarm, Magic Missiles, Bloodstorm, War Spirit, Crucify, Storm Crows, Broadside, Queen of Blades, Rebound, Guard Tower, Fortress, Blindside, Cascade, Spore Shot, Elemental (pre-1.99d), Hunting Banshee, Faerie Fire, Widowmaker, Frostclaw Totem, Liche Form, Vessel of Judgement, Frozen Soul, Nova Charge and Bladestorm. Removing it is not an option. :P<br /></ul>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Spell Timer related</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Whenever I use a skill with a timer it locks any other timered skill! Why is this happening?</span><br />
A0:</strong> The game hates you. :twisted:<br />
<strong>A1:</strong> The use of any timered skill automatically locks any other timer skill. Also, the running timer length is applied to all timered skills, even if their own is lower. Eg:<br />
<ul>You use Dark Summoning, which has a 30 seconds timer.<br />
 Then you want to use Blink, which has a much shorter timer. <br />
You <strong>won't</strong> be able of using Blink until those 30 seconds pass.*</ul><br />
*However, you can use an Elixir of Adrenaline to cancel the running timer.<br />
<em>NB:</em> Remember that the passive skill Premeditation <strong>only works</strong> on skills in the Assasin trees. Even if a timered oskill comes from Assasin only gear, it won't be affected.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: But the timers are too long! They make skills useless!</span><br />
A:</strong> Most timered skills have a built-in way of reducing the timer, be it via Hard Points synergies or simple skill level. Note that some skills <em>won't</em> reach zero timer, never. Timered oskills are usually between those.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: If a timered skill has reached zero timer, is it normal that it still gets locked when I use a skill which does have a timer?</span><br />
A:</strong> Sadly, the game's being a little piggish here. There's a display bug with skills whose timer is under 3 frames duration, the game doesn't show the timer, but it does exist and lock as usual until it hits zero frames.<br />
Needless to say, skills with real zero frames timer won't lock out any other, nor will be locked when you use another timered skill.</ul></p>

<p>(This whole section was written by NexX)</p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">What does Skill X do?</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I use Bacchanalia / Witch Blood to increase the power of my oSkills/procs?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Sadly no.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> Those strange spell damage things require coding for each skill they affect, because they are just pretty synergies. Making them work like true +% spell damage would be nice, but of course passives don't update properly.<br />
(A by Brother Laz)</p>

<p>Note: They <em>do</em> affect procs of your class' skills</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: My "Wedding Dress of the Zann" (tiered Unique Ceremonial Armor) has +#-## Moon Queen, but I don't see it in my skills. What is it?</span><br />
A:</strong> It's similar to the Amazon Passive of the same name. It grants Increased Attack Speed, %Enhanced Damage.<br />
And like the Amazon passive, all the bonuses work on all weapons.

<p>Note, however, that coming from a charm or as an oSkill (read: soft points), the %EWD and %ED remain constant.<br />
Note, as of 1.D9, Moon Warrior also grants +Life on Kill from hard points. As an oSkill, you don't get that.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What is that red aura under my/monster's feet?</span><br />
A:</strong> It's Demon Blood Aura.<br />
It gives 28%-51% max life, depending on your clvl (28% at level 1, 51% at 120), as well as +4*clvl liferegen and +3% elementaldamage/slvl.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Q: What is the 'Amazing Grace' item modifier?</strong> It appears on every Paladin-specific spear, as well as a few other items.<br />
<strong>A:</strong></span> It grants you 5% chance to cast on-attack a kind of immunity shield: 100% avoid for 1.2 seconds.<br />
Its graphic effect is Fade + a blue 'firehit' animation.<br />
Like all other immunity shields, it does not benefit from B/D/C modifiers.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What's that Town Portal thingy on Nihlathak's minion?<br />
OMGWTF! It just 1-shotted me!</span><br />
A1:</strong> What you just experienced was Rathma's Chosen, a Necromancer Uberskill which grants invulnerability to all damage (except damage over time), as well as 25k-50k magic damage/slvl.<br />
Kickass, huh?</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What is Elemental Guide?</span><br />
A:</strong> It's an Ice-elemental version of Spirit Guide.<br />
It grants (40% + 10%/slvl) %ED to anyone in a 6.6 yard radius.<br />
It is worth noting that this overrides their own aura that yields 3/2 Defense and 25% DR (requires 1 hard point).<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <br />
"NexX" wrote:<br /><blockquote>the source UMO (HoF) can only give you up to +7 to EG on a single item, further applications do rise other modifiers but this one. </blockquote><br />
Not a bug. This is due to savebit-limit.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I had UA/HA active but I died! What's going on? The documentation says that it provides an invulnerability shield!</span><br />
A:</strong> UA/HA doesn't <em>actually</em> make you invulnerable. It 'merely' grants 50k damage reduction.<br />
There are some special attacks that can pierce its damage reduction, e.g. Death Projector, Crystal Ball, Astrogha's Frozen orb. Anything that does more then 50k damage will still kill you.</p>

<p>Also, it doesn't ignore poison damage / Life Degeneration / Damage over Time (such as Duriel's Exorcism), so you should take care about high-damage poison attacks since they can lower your HP even to 1 point (for Poison / Life Degen), which means you're nearly dead as soon as the UA/HA duration ends, or just kill you (for Damage over Time, i.e. Exorcism).<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Why is the listed damage of Shatter the Flesh so low?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Because it hits 8 times, instantly.<br />
So to get your <em>actual</em> damage, check the skill description or multiply the LCS-listed damage * 8.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How does Trinity (the Amazon Bow Devotion) work?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Like it says. If your attack does #-## &lt;element&gt; damage, it adds its bonus to the max-damage.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Which is more effective in late game: Nova charge or Hive? </span><br />
A:</strong> They're different. NC will do serious damage at close range, but you need to keep an enemy within range to have it do damage and it isn't effective at longer distances. Hive needs to be applied only once (and will do the same damage regardless of distance) and then ticks away for X seconds, making it much more effective for cowards and ranged characters who can do a hit and run or just loiter near enemies and reliably poison them. The downside is that it does less damage per second than NC at full blast.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Skills that convert damage to &lt;element&gt;, will +%&lt;element&gt; spell damage increase the converted damage?</span><br />
A:</strong> No.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> The only way to increase a percentile-based's damage is to increase what it's a percentile of. (In this case: Your damage.)<br />
The same is true for Feedback spells, where you need to increase your life/mana as required.<br />
N.B.<br />
Using the appropriate '-enemy resist' <em>will</em> increase the damage done by the converted portion.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How is Fortress with Stances treated by MXL? Is it treated as a spell? Is it treated as a minion? Is it treated as a ranged attack? Would it benefit from poison duration?</span><br />
A2:</strong> Fortress is basically a complicated missile chain. The towers are actually immobile missiles, just like Bloodstorm. As such, they are considered a "spell". Stances don't affect them but since stances affect YOU, Fortress does benefit from stances. Similarly, Bloodstorm benefits from your own Bloodlust.<br />

<p><ul><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Basics</span></em></p>

<p><ul>First things first:<br />
<ul>* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hirelings</span> (a.k.a. mercs) are not affected by any of the '+% <Minion Stat>' item modifiers.<br />
They do, however, benefit from any +%resists on their equipment.<br />
 * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Totems</span> are not affected by any of the '+% <Minion Stat>' item modifiers.<br />
The Totems do, however, inherit your %spell damage, -%enemy resist, and total Energy Factor,<br />
 * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reanimates</span> are not affected by any of the '+% <Minion Stat>' item modifiers.<br />
 * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minions</span> cannot become elementally immune from the '+%minion resists' item modifier. (*1) (*2)<br />
They <em>can</em> become immune with the addition of auras/buffs/etc.<br />
* Note: Assassin's Bat(strike) Familiars are the exception to this rule.<br />
They can become elementally immune from +% 'minion resist' gear only; even on Destruction difficulty.<br />
It's a unique feature of theirs.</ul></p>

<p>(*1) With the exception of Hatred. In Hatred, an slvl 5+ minion can become elementally immune with +25% minion resists.<br />
Note, however, that this immunity is invisible, and won't show up on the minion.<br />
Minions under slvl 5 are trickier, so I'm not going into that  :P</p>

<p>(*2) As of MXL 1.A9, slvl 5+ minions can <em>also</em> become elementally immune in <strong>Terror</strong>.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Verified, thanks to terryys.<br />
<strong><a href="http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/8077/screenshot007eqg.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot or it didn't happen</a></strong>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Point of Interest:</strong> In D2, versions 1.10+, Minions are <em>not</em> affected by your /players setting.</span><br />
That said, monsters spawned on /p8 <em>do</em> keep the life (and damage &amp; %AR on Terror / Destruction) bonus when Resurrected via Paladin Uberskill.</p>


<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What level skills do Mercs use?</span><br />
A2:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="hirelings.html" target="_blank">Merc Skill Levels</a></span><br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: If I have several different ReAnimates, am I limited to 1 ReAnimate per kill?</span><br />
A2:</strong> No.<br />
Every kill will roll (check if it triggered or not) <em>all</em> of your %Reanimates.<br />
However, a Reanimation uses up a corpse. So, if you had twenty 10% reanimates, you could get every single one of them from a single kill... but only if there were twenty corpses around... If more than one roll "succeeds", a nearby corpse will spit out a reanimate and explode. If there aren't enough nearby bodies, you won't get a reanimate.</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How do +%Minion Damage and +%ED buffs interact? Are they additive or multiplicative?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Contrary to what I previously though, apparently additive.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Does %minion damage/%minion health have a cap, or can you just keep adding it up?</span><br />
A2:</strong> Minion life is always uncapped, but minion damage is generally capped at 2k. This is base damage which is ONLY based on slvl; %miniondamage will then heighten this 2k further, as will any spells that increase damage.</ul><br />
(This and above A by Borgin, Q by Myk and bishxc, respectively)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Barbarian Spirits have capped Life as well. Shamanic Trance adds obscene amounts of %minion life, and even now they roll over (seems to occur between 135 and 145k).</p></ul>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Minion Resists</span></em></p>

<p><ul><span style="font-size: 13px;"><strong>Q: When it says +% summon resistances. Is it really a percentage or simply a figure?</strong><br />
(Lets say my summon has a base resistance of 25. does +20% summon resistances make it 20 + 25 = 45 resists, or 25+(20%*25) = 30 resists?</span><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Minion resists work like your own.<br />
i.e. 20% + 25% = 45%. <br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How are minions affected by the difficulty-based <span style="text-decoration: underline;">penalty</span> to resists?</span><br />
A:</strong> Exactly the same way you are.<br />
Resists per difficulty are 0/-50/-100.</p>

<p>That said...</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What are the minions' base resists?</span><br />
A:</strong> Every minion gains +15% to all resistances per skill level, capping at +75% at level 5. Items with +% minion resists, as well as curses with -% resists, are applied at the end. <br />
Totems are the exception, they have 0% base resists at all levels and difficulties, and do not benefit from +% minion resists. Lower Resist affects them, though.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What are the minions' max resists (without buffs / auras)?</span><br />
A:</strong> +75% minion resists, will get you to the item-mod cap.<br />
This means that (assuming level 5+ minions):<br />
<ul>In Hatred with +0% minion resists, minions have 75% resists.<br />
In Hatred with +75% or more minion resists, minions have 150% resists.<br />
In Terror with +0% minion resists, minions have 25% resists.<br />
In Terror with +75% or more minion resists, minions have 100% resists.<br />
In Destruction with +0% minion resists, minions have -25% resists.<br />
In Destruction with +75% or more minion resists, minions have 50% resists.</ul><br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Is it just me or my Shadowfiends not getting affected by any aura/most of buffs?!</span><br />
A:</strong> It's just you, they do get affect, but they don't get the animation because of bein' <em>too cool</em> for it.<br /></ul>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Prebuffing</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: If I stack +skills / spell damage / +minion <stat>, cast a long duration buff / summon a minion and then take them off / swap weapon, will the spell / minion keep the bonuses?</span><br />
A:</strong> For the most part, yes, since minion stats and (most) buff effects are determined when the minion is created / buff is cast.</p>

<p>This is called 'Prebuffing'.</p>

<p>There are a couple of exceptions, though.</p>

<p>The exceptions are Hive and Nova Charge, Queen of Blades, Beacon, Liche Form and Vessel of Judgement.</p>

<p>They will keep the +skills (used for calculating duration) and +buff duration you used when you cast the skill (your prebuff gear), but their damage, on the other hand, is determined when the missiles are created, so they'll inherit your "regular" gear's %spell damage and +skills.<br />
As well, VoJ won't keep prebuffed-L&S bonuses.<br />

<p>Also, see next.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: So I did that, and all my extra minions (or oSkill minions) die!</span><br />
A:</strong> This is another exception. Minion stats are determined when the minion is created. Minion quantity, on the other hand, is updated every so often; most particularly when you cast a buff / swap equipment.<br />
And 'excessive' minions that you have will be unsummoned when this happens.<br />
In the case of oSkill minions, your 'natural' amount is 0, so...</p>

<p>This is known as the "Unowned Skill Summon Bug".</p>

<p>Note:<br />
Interestingly, having +skills will allow you to keep specific minions for a short (~30 sec) while longer.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Umm, I just put some signets of experience/gold/learning on my belt and used shift+ 1/2/3/4 to make my merc eat them. It doesn't work. Fix plz. </span><br />
A:</strong> ... You know, the game didn't let you simply drop them in the merc's portrait for a reason, they don't work, they're not suposed to work. <br />
And however, why would you give spendable stat points/gold to your merc? The only usable ones would be the experience ones and helping a merc to level up a bit isn't worth the effort of trying to make D2 understand it and getting it to work. <br />

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Pet Commands</span></em></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: What gets affected by Pet Commands?</span><br />
A:</strong> <strong>Only</strong> charmed monsters and reanimates without auras are affected, <strong>not</strong> your minions / hireling / party <span style="text-decoration: underline;">despite the graphic on them</span>.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Wait wait WHAT?!</span><br />
A:</strong> You heard me.</p>

<p>One exception: the Thunderbear oSkill (from the Spirit Mask tiered unique).<br />

<p>[list]<strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I'm trying to do one of the Uber Quests, and I can't hurt the boss! What gives?</span><br />
A:</strong> The boss has an invisible immunity.<br />
See next.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Why doesn't the immunity show up?</span><br />
A:</strong> It doesn't show up on the unit because Blizzard can't code, and I sure am not going to abandon shield auras because of this.</p>

<p>Shield aura + Magic Resistant = Elemental Immunity.<br />
Shield aura + Mana Burn = Huge Elemental resistance.<br />
Shield aura + [element] Enchanted = Single Elemental Immunity.<br />
Shield aura + Stone Skin = Physical Immunity.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: <span style="color: yellow;">Djiin</span>, <span style="color: yellow;">Ifrit</span>!</strong> I get hit. I get teleported. The world explodes in Lightning or Fire (respectively) and I die. What gives?</span><br />
<strong>A:</strong> They tell you about the teleportation in their description.<br />
See that swirling thing under your feet?<br />
That's what they <em>don't</em> tell you about. It's one of the Assassin's time bomb.<br />

Then I'm suddenly buried in an avalanche! ARG~!</span><br />
<strong>A:</strong> They have a chance to cast multiple Showers of Rocks (as the Barbarian skill) when they hit you.<br />
These SoRs create an 'impact zone' shadow on the floor. Once you see that, you have a ~2 second delay before they land.<br />
Don't just stand there like an ogre. Bob and weave, you fool.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: <span style="color: yellow;">Cruciators</span> / <span style="color: yellow;">Trap Rats!</span> Cruci-what? Who cares about the small ones! They're cute and shoot fire knives! Better tell me why the big ones are harpoon-shooter machineguns and how to not get wtfmurdered!!</span><br />
A0:</strong> RUN!1oneoneeleven! (Seriously, the fact that something <em>can</em> be killed doesn't meant you <em>must</em> kill it.)<br />
<strong>A1:</strong> About Trap Rats, well, note that they're stationary and that once they spot you, you'll see they start "looking" at you, doing nothing. <br />
That's their dreaded "stare of pwnage", it lasts like 2 secs until a flurry of giant spines is shot. If you feel like you can give them a beating, go on right when you spot them, if you usually fight in melee you'll possibly be used to tank strong attacks and will deal with them in no time. Remember that they come in packs of 4-5 and that Malah has an unlimited health potion store.<br />
For casters, use the kind of tricky magicks you prefer, no caster that can kill other Act 5 elites will have too much trouble with these. Same for ranged characters. Summoners may want to ignore them or (OMG) <strong>waste</strong> 2-3 mins of their time for their mobs to kill them. <br />
Avoid using magic element damage, don't stand on a place too long. You'll be fine.<br />
(Editor's Note: Also, getting 100 flat DR makes those Trap Rats a joke on Hatred, and very survivable on Terror still :) )<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: <span style="color: yellow;">Daystars</span> / <span style="color: yellow;">Deathless</span>!</strong> I'm walking around Act 2/5 (respectively), when suddenly flames erupt from the ground, crisping me in seconds!</span><br />
<strong>A:</strong> The elite Vampires are to blame for this pyrotechnical cataclysm. (It's called 'Angelfire'.)<br />
Obvious answer 1: Don't just stand there!<br />
Obvious answer 2: Max that fire Resistance!</p>

<p>Now for the less obvious answers.<br />
* Flawless/Perfect Bloodstones in any armor except shields will increase your maximal fire resist by 1%/2% each, respectively, as well as granting a large resistance bonus, as will Rubies in shields.<br />
Gemwords make even better use of this, since you can use resist jewels (for example) as well.</p>

<p>* It's a damage per frame skill, so the amount of damage each hit deals is actually rather low. If you have a source of +# Fire Absorb or # Magic Damage Reduction, this will help alot.<br />
(Angelfire hits 25 times per second. The reduction is applied to *each and every* hit, giving you a 2500% higher benefit then the listed value.)</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: This actually works.<br />
Unlike most per-frame attacks, Angelfire does <em>not</em> use the MDR 1/25 effect code added to Firewall et. al.</p></ul>

<p><ul><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">-% &lt;element&gt; enemy resists</span></em>:</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Can I remove immunities from enemies?</span><br />
A:</strong> You can use resistance reducing skills (*1) to remove an immunity off an enemy. These skills do however only work at 1/5 effectiveness if the target is immune. Items with -x% to Enemy [Element] Resistance do not break immunities by themselves, but can be used to further reduce an enemy's resistance after the immunity has been removed with a skill. Note that if an enemy is completely immune to all elements, this is usually an uberquest enemy and there is a trick to killing it. Consult the description of the uberquest.<br />
(From the official FAQ)</p>

<p>(*1) The only such skills in Median XL as of 1.Z9 are the Assassin's Phase Bomb uberskill (which reduces enemy elemental resist by a listed amount), the Amazon's Spellbind Ennead skill (breaks Physical immunities; has -50% Enemy DR.) and the Starbreaker SU Mace which has 2% slv1 Starfire on attack (-5% elemental resists).</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I have -9835a76r214% enemy &lt;element&gt; resist, but it's still immune!!!</span><br />
A:</strong> Uh huh.<br />
Now <em>READ</em> the previous answer.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How does the '-%&lt;element&gt; enemy resist' item modifier work?</span><br />
A:</strong> It is not a debuff. It is not an aura.<br />
It is a part of the damage calculation, and as such is counted only when damage <strong>by the person wearing it</strong> is rolled.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Do my minions / hirelings / reanimate / attack totems benefit from my -% resist?</span><br />
A:</strong> That depends.</p>

<p><ul>* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the '-% &lt;element&gt; enemy resist' <strong>item modifier</strong></span>:</p>

<p>Aside from the Necro Attack-totems, no one 'inherits' your -% resist, so any of it that you have on your equipment will only benefit any damage that is considered yours.<br />
In other words, what benefits: <br />
<ul><em>Your</em> +&lt;element&gt; damage to weapon.<br />
<em>Your</em> &lt;element&gt;-damage spells.<br />
<em>Your</em> attack totems</ul><br />
Necro attack totems are a special case, in that they <strong>do</strong> inherit your -% resist, despite being minions.</p>

<p>What does <em>not</em> benefit:<br />
<ul>Anyone's Minions.<br />
Anyone's Hirelings. (Unless the hireling is the one wearing the -%resist, in which case it benefits, you don't.)<br />
Any Reanimates.<br />
(Any elemental damage from) your Team-mates.</ul></p>

<p>* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For any '-% &lt;element&gt; enemy resist' <strong>skill</strong></span>:</p>

<p>Unlike the item modifier, the skills directly affect your enemy's resists.</p>

<p>That being the case, <strong>any</strong> source of elemental damage to the affected target is increased.</ul></ul></p>

<p><em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Drop Bias related</span></em>:</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Do drop bias affect only Destruction difficulty? Or do I have a greater chance to find rares/uniques/etc. also in Hatred and Terror?</span><br />
A:</strong> As a rule: Yes, the drop bias works in all difficulties.<br />
The exception is the MO drop from Bull Prince Rodeo, and of course the sacred bias in Duncraig / Set bias in K3K.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Do all the monsters in Destruction Fauztinville and Toraja have a chance to drop Great Runes, or just the bosses?</span><br />
A:</strong> <em>Every</em> monster can drop Great Runes.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Corpse issues</em></span></p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I know that in Terror and Destruction difficulty when I am killed I lose a part of my experience depending of the difficulty level. Can I recover some of this experience?</span><br />
A:</strong> Yes, you can, but you must recover your corpse <strong>before you Save and Exit</strong>. You recover a portion of the experience lost, per corpse.<br />
If you quit and save the game, you can recover the most valuable corpse (in terms of money) and its gear but not your lose experience.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How many corpses can I have at a time?</span><br />
A:</strong> Up to 16 corpses at a time. If you lose more corpses, no new corpse are created.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Hey, when I die and I had an oskill coming from my gear, I keep it without having that gear piece!</span><br />
A:</strong> It's a bug. When you die, sometimes the character thinks that he still has those oskills and will be able to use them. <br />
However, it happens kinda randomly, so loading on oskill gear and dying won't let you profit from that bug. Oh, also the skills disappear when you put some new gear piece on  <br />
Also there's an even wierder version of this bug: <br />
Sometimes when you die with an oskill stance on, you'll respawn in town with regular attack mapped under the rmb, but with that stance overlay and effects fully applied. Still, once you change to some other skill the bug fixes by itself and the stance disappears. <br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Do mercenaries hired at lower levels gain better stats?</span><br />
A: No</strong>. No matter what you may have heard until now, <em>the level at which the merc is hired is completely irrelevant</em>. What does matter is the difficulty in which it was originally hired. A merc hired in Hatred has better stats than the same type of merc hired in Terror, and a merc hired in Terror has better stats than the same type of merc hired in Destruction.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How can I stop those @#(&amp;% bosses from regenerating?</span><br />
A:</strong><br />

<p>For Dark Star Dragon (for example):<br />
There are three ways:</p>

<p><ul>The "Prevent Monster Heal" mod. It prevents all monsters from regenerating. Available as part of the Nightmare curse (oSkill, proc / %ctc, and cast by Priests of Rathma) and as part of the Void Archon's Warp Field aura.<br />
Poison. Monsters do not regenerate while poisoned. Once the poison wears off, however, they start regenerating again.<br />
Open Wounds. Being affected by open wounds automatically sets the monsters' regeneration rate to a negative value.</p>

<p>Also note that these methods only negate natural regeneration. Things such as healing spells (e.g Akarat) will work as usual with Poison and OW.<br />
PMH does negate healing spells, though.</p></ul>

<p>(This and previous writeup, ummm, "borrowed" (and 'translated' to MXL) from Ernir's <a href="http://www.battle.net/forums/thread.aspx?fn=d2-general&t=1312543&p=1&#post1312543" target="_blank">Things you SHOULD know about Diablo 2</a>.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Why doesn't the 'Hit Causes Monster to Flee' modifier always work as intended?</span><br />
A:</strong> Works only on regular monsters.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Umm, what the heck goes on in Bremmtown? I mean, if I attack by holding shift I don't hit anything, and if I try to dash with my attack skill in the rmb, I just get to the monsters and then I don't attack!!</span><br />
A:</strong> Actually, what happens is that Howling Spirits have both a very small footprint ("physical" space the monster takes) and a extremely long melee attack range, this makes them pretty hard to target and hit with some melee skills, as well as it stops you from dash-killing. <br />
This is NOT a bug, you actually have aim at stuff and attack, not just clicking and holding until everything dies. <br />

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How do I trade items with other people?</span></strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> There are 2 ways to go about trading:<br />
1) Direct person-to-person, in game.<br />
2) Indirect, by sending a save (.d2s) file.</p>

<p>Trading in-game is intuitive, so this is an explanation for option #2.</p>

<p>Method #1:<br />
Create a new character.<br />
Give this character whichever items you are trading.</p>

<p>Method #2:<br />
Create a new character.<br />
Put whichever items you are trading in this char's Private Stash.</p>

<p>Then either:<br />
Send an e-mail with the &lt;charname&gt;.d2s for method #1, or &lt;charname&gt;.d2x for method #2, as an attachment, (Or you can dcc it via most chat programs, but that's more complicated.)<br />
or:<br />
Go to a file hosting site*,<br />
Upload the file, receive link.<br />
Send this link to whomever you're trading with.<br />
(They download the file, and move the items off the character you sent.)</p>

<p>*e.g. Rapidshare-type.<br />
Commonly people use zippyshare.com, since it requires no registration/hassle.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 15px;"><strong>Cautionary tip:</strong></span><br />
If you're using Method #1 and PlugY, remember that the last page you had open is saved as the character's stash in the .d2s</p>

<p>Method #2 doesn't have this problem.</ul></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: How do I downgrade from 1.13  to 1.12?</span><br />
(Or any other version, for that matter.)<br />
A:</strong> Use D2SE</a>.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: After installing the Glide Wrapper, D2 decides that instead of starting up, it's just gonna do a workout of random characters in the upper left corner of my monitor for about 5 minutes, and then it gets the hint and starts up. How do I whip it into shape?</span><br />
A:</strong> This is a bug with the Glide Wrapper and Vista. To fix it, go to your Diablo 2 folder, right click on "game.exe", and go to properties. Go to the compatibility tab, and check "Disable Desktop Composition". You are now good to go.<br />

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Game Crashes</em></span>:</p>

<ul><p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q:</span> In multiplayer, every time I try to Save and Exit, or even in mid-game, I crash out with a "You have been Disconnected" message (other players see "(Playername)'s carrier pigeon was eaten by a hawk"), and all my character progress (and newly gained items!) are lost! T_T<br />
<span style="font-size: 13px;">A:</span></strong> You have too many items in your PlugY personal and shared stashes. Diablo 2 can only save files less than (I believe) 8k total at exit. If you're crashing, and items aren't saving, either throw some items out, or temporarily remove your shared stash. Note that this bug only exists for TCP/IP games.<br />
(Writeup by Koiu Lpoi)</p>

<p>Alternatively, there's another solution - just type /save and wait about a full minute before S+E'ing. PlugY will save the file.<br />

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: The game keeps crashing!</span><br />
A:</strong> <ul>1) If you get an error message with a 'line #<number>', use the 'Search' function.<br />
The answers to the most frequent ones are on the forum.<br />
2) "Koiu Lpoi" wrote:<br /><blockquote>If you're on the English US version of the game, download <a href="http://www.quicksfv.org/" target="_blank">QuickSFV</a>, and install it.

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Mercanaries / Hirelings</em></span>:</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q:</span> Why is it that after my mercenary dies he loses a good amount of movement speed and reflexes as well as attack damage?<br />
<span style="font-size: 13px;">Q:</span> Every time I revive my act5 merc, his damage decreases, and he becomes less aggressive.<br />
A:</strong> It is a bug, but it is a D2 bug. Merc passives are lost on death for the duration of the current game. Unfixable. (Answer by Brother Laz)<br />
(For version 1.95 test 3 and prior, See "Hireling is your Friend" linked thread for details on Merc passives<br />
For version 1.95 Release and after, mercs no longer have passives. The Hireling page on the respective documentation page gives their skillsets.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Umm, my merc got stuck...</span><br />
A1:</strong> Try teleporting (Blinking, rather  :P) / using a Town Portal / Waypoint.<br />
If that doesn't 'fix them', ignore them or S&amp;E.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> Merc AI is bugged if you 'walk'. Blizzard never discovered this because <em>who walks in d2 lololol.</em> (A2 by Brother Laz)</ul></p>

<!--
THIS HAS BEEN FIXED:
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Belts</em></span>:</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: Are there any belts with more than 2 rows?</span><br />
A:</strong> Due to a Diablo II engine limitation, additional rows are hardcoded to the classic LoD belt types.<br />
(From the official FAQ)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: My Sacred belt only has one row!</span><br />
A:</strong> Due to a Diablo II engine limitation, belts that do not have the 'belt' itemtype have only one visible row. The other row exists, but is not accessible. Filling up your belt with shift-click and using potions with the number keys does work, though.<br />
(From the official FAQ)</p>

<p>Also note that swapping to a tiered belt of any kind, and then swapping back will allow you to see the 2nd row, until you Save and Exit (or possibly die and retrieve your corpse).</ul></p>-->

TOO OLD, DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE:
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: "Always use Unholy Combat Skills" modifier, (which exists on the Black Sun Spear SU,) what does it do?</span><br />
A:</strong> Sadly, nothing. But it's supposed to let you use Black Sleep/Lemures/Blood Thorns/Shadowfiends without being in the Terror Strike state.<br />
Incidentally, there used to be a similar modifier back in '08 which allowed the use of retailatory skills without being struck.</p>-->

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Quest bugs</em></span>:</p>

<p><ul><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I activated Gidbinn fire, but no monsters show up. What now?</span><br />
A1:</strong> Step 1) Save and Exit, try again.<br />
If that doesn't work, Step 2) Reset your map*.<br />
<strong>A2:</strong> It's a bug that was around in cLoD too--sometimes the gidbinn flayer is spawned outside of the map, meaning you can't kill him and complete the quest. Blizzards fault, not Laz's. <br />
(* See below.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: WTF? I just cleared the Den of Evil with my cold sorc and now quest log says I have to kill 654897 more mobs!! I mean WTF?!</span><br />
A:</strong> In short, shattered corpses ( obtained by killing frozen mobs) make D2 angry, that's why old, non-ice immune Shenk was bugged and it's the reason why the quest log says you have to kill 600K+mobs yet. Do the following:<br />
Save and exit, pick up a stick and whack the living daylights outta them, it's the friggin' Den of Evil what we're talking about.<br />
(Writeup by NexX)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I killed Shenk the Overseer (Act 5, 'Siege of Harrogath' target), but the quest isn't completed!</span><br />
A:</strong> Blame Blizzard's crappily coded quest.<br />
Folk wisdom cures:<br />
<ul>Do not use cold attacks. Shattering his corpse will not let the quest complete.<br />
Be sure that you killed him on the platform. Apparently he needs to die on it for the quest to complete.</ul><br />

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>Diablo 2 known bugs</em></span>:</p>

<ul><p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: My Character Screen/Sheet says X, but Y says Z!</span><br />
A:</strong> It's a fact of 'life'. The Character Screen lies. (Hence: LCS. Lying Character Screen/Sheet.)</p>

<p>An example: <ul>1) Although +% elemental damage boosts character screen damage for ranged weapon attacks and weapon damage explosions it actually doesn't.<br />
2) Although -%&lt;element&gt; enemy resists do not show a damage increase on the LCS, they do in fact increase all damage of that element (regardless of whether it's delivered in melee, range, or by spell.), but only against non-immunes.<br />
And since the increase isn't global, it isn't reflected in the LCS.</ul><br />
(As listed in the 'What modifiers does my attack carry?' list.<br />
for more, see the "How +% spell damage works" link.)</p>

<p>Another example:<ul>Poison damage.<br />
Even without +% spell damage to mess things up, the LCS sucks Monsterballs when it comes to poison damage.</ul><br />
Explanation:<br />
The LCS displays total damage per hit.<br />
Poison's damage isn't done instantly. It's done over time.<br />
So, using a high duration poison source (e.g. Curare) and your fist (~1-3 damage), the LCS will display 50k+ damage.<br />
Obviously, your hit won't be doing the whole 50k at once.</p>

<p>Also, a passive source of poison (e.g. WotS) in combination with poison damage on your weapon will (usually) drastically change your LCS-listed damage. See next.</p>

<p>For more about poison damage, read nimrod's Poison damage explained thread (linked above).</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: My gems are not upgraded by a Gem Shrine!</span><br />
A:</strong> Due to a Diablo II engine limitation, the new gems are not considered gems in some parts of the game.<br />
(From the official FAQ)</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Q: I found a Waypoint, but I can't activate it. What gives?</span><br />
A1:</strong> It's an occasional problem with D2 (Map generation?).<br />
Stand <strong>on</strong> the WP and open a TP, and the WP will become usable.<br />
(Credit for this goes to... Umm, I've forgotten :oops: )</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Version 1.10:</span> Charges are considered Hard Points.</strong><br />
This is known as the Marrowalk bug.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Bug: The +% resist bonus(es) from Malah's "Scroll(s) of Resistance" is lost on death, until S&E.</strong></span><br />
This loss isn't shown on the LCS, though.<br />
This is known as the Anya Bug.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Bug: +%AR with ranged attacks.</strong></span><br />
To summarize the enormous TL;DR that this used to be:<br />
+%AR works fine on anything except +%AR on a skill.<br />
In such a case, any missiles will consider the +%AR to be +AR, and the LCS will lie, i.e. show % instead of # AR.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13px;">Bug: PDR/MDR Overflow, reducing the 'other' type too.</strong></span><br />
"SSoG" wrote:<br /><blockquote>There's this little thing in the game called the "PDR/MDR Overflow Mechanic". We're all pretty sure that it's a bug, but as long as it exists and it isn't game-breaking, we might as well benefit from it. A good thread about the topic can be found <a href="http://www.theamazonbasin.com/d2/forums/index.php?showtopic=49005&st=0" target="_blank">here</a>. Anyway, the quick and easy explanation is that if you have TOO MUCH PDR OR MDR, then the extra will "overflow" until the end of the damage application equation and negate other types of damage.</p>

<p>An example. Let's say you have 20 PDR, 0 MDR, and get hit by an attack that deals 10 physical and 10 fire damage.</p>

<p>Step 1: Reduce the physical damage by PDR. You're now taking -10 physical damage.<br />
Step 2: Reduce the elemental damage by MDR. You're now taking 10 fire damage.<br />
Step 3: Add together all the damage. You're now taking 0 damage.</blockquote><br />

"Necrolis" wrote:<br /><blockquote>actually ... it DOESN'T overflow,<br />
what happens is the game does the flat subtraction, but some fool forgot an max(0,x), so it yields a negative number,<br />
and what does the game do to negative damage? It turns it into + life <snip>, so technically superflous MDR &amp; DR is turned in "+life when taking damage"(just that its added before the check to see if you've died)</blockquote><br />
"jmerry" wrote:<br /><blockquote>From what I read, there's still a check at the end to make total damage >=0. It's just that this isn't done per type.</blockquote><br />
(Thanks to cuzno for pointing this one out (and providing the quote &amp; link), and to Necrolis and jmerry for their input [on pages 9-10 of this thread])</p></ul>
