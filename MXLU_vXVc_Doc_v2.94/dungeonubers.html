          Horazon the Summoner summoned a powerful demonlord that was too strong and overwhelmed him. He managed to trap it in his
          arcane sanctuary, but could not defeat it and it almost killed him. To save his own life, Horazon split off the prison

          Ruined Fane (Act 3: Kurast Causeway)</p>

          <p class="content"><b>Lore</b><br />
          Back in the days when Kurast was the centre of civilisation and black magic was not yet frowned upon, this was where the
          priests of Rathma - the necromancers - practiced their art. The place was abandoned when the religion of Zakarum took
          over the city and banned pagan magic, making it the perfect hiding place for an ancient evil bent on taking out the
          Church from within. Primus, son of Mephisto, was the leader of the Cult of the Triune in ages past before its
          destruction. His efforts to rebuild the Triune were shut down by the crusaders of Zakarum, but he remains a formidable
          foe, doubly so in the home city of the Zakarum.</p>

          <p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
          Primus himself is not particularly hard, despite his powerful ranged Bladestorm attack. The blades track your position,
          but do less damage than his normal attack and can be avoided, blocked and dodged. His guard dogs are the real challenge.
          After several millennia in and around Rathma Square, his Gore Crawlers can raise themselves from the dead. Shattering the
          corpse does not stop this, but the resurrection takes 10 seconds, during which you can attempt to run away and ditch
          them.</p>

          According to religious myth, the mortal plane � Sanctuary � was created by the fallen angel Inarius and the demon

          birthright and ancient powers inherited from their supernatural parents. As the edyrem army grew, Inarius descended into

          Vizjun, the mechanised home city of the Viz-Jaq&#39;Taar buit on the ruins of a magical war, recently ran into a major
          system error. The artificial intelligence, the Master Control System seems to have developed evil sentience as Diablo

								<br />Uldyssian ul-Diomed. Once only a simple farmer, but the spiteful vicissitudes of Sanctuary were not satisfied. The ghosts of Seram grew restless, and Lilith, Queen of the Succubi, began to torment those of the old bloodlines. Marked by fate, Uldyssian rose to become a boy-king, rallying others like him to defend Seram and to defend all of Sanctuary. They would become his warriors of light: the Edyrem.
                The blood of the Nephalem was ubiquitous, but Uldyssian gathered them all. The blood of the Nephalem was mighty, and they burned a path through all who would fight for Hatred, eventually defeating Hatred's Daughter herself. But victory was only passing. Lilith, undying, lived on through the very powers she had been defeated with.
								<br />
								<br />Now ruled by their Dark Edyrem King, the tortured, reality-warping visions of the warriors of light are sealed beneath Aranoch, waiting for one to release them from their eternal curse.
								<br />

              <p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
								<br />The cursed descendants of the Nephalem manifest their torment in memories of battles won and lost. Some of their forms may be familiar, others eldritch and baffling. If you can defeat all of them, you will find the Dark King himself. Atop his throne, within his prison. Free him, and let the Edyrem rest at last.<!-- Each one of his memories has different types of magic, resistances, and graphics. Their life, defense, damage, attack rate, scale for every higher tier boss. All have
								75% Avoid, base 95% Fire/Lightning/Cold/Poison and 25% Magic/Physical resistances.-->
								<br />

                <br />But be warned. The Edyrem were strong in their own right. Attainted by the mother of Sanctuary, the mother of deceit, they are demigods. <br/>

							<p class="content">Against Uldyssian, you need the basic purify strategy - purify and keep Open Wounds active on him.
								<br />But be careful on this step, since he will use Deathstrike when damaged, and if it kills you he might heal his entire life.
								<br />Be careful, he teleports, so make sure he doesn't teleport to you if you use the stairs to go to the palace, because he might follow you. Use a town portal to avoid this.
								<br />The only way to avoid his traps that instantly kill you is to either run, move to another part of the map or lure him trough the stairs.

          The World Nexus (Act 3: Flayer Jungle)</p>

          <p class="content"><b>Lore</b><br />
          A violent death often leaves a spirit or poltergeist behind. Most spirits are weak, manifesting only as a sobbing on the
          wind or dancing ghost lights at night. Some grow stronger in death and guard their final resting place with unholy
          fury.</p>

          <p class="content"><b>Strategy</b><br />
          The great witch's resting place is guarded by two upper levels, which are themselves black labyrinths haunted by lesser witches.
          The matron's handmaidens summon up dread fire from the void - gloaming flames that track your movements and grasp at your very soul. Do not let these fires touch you,
          lest you be lost to the maze. If you can manage to navigate your way to the depths of the Nexus and traverse its bridges carefully, you will find yourself in the World Nexus,
          where the very planes themselves are born. It is said that the souls of those who sought forbidden knowledge are entangled in its black mire, doomed to travel the dark endlessly.
          Maybe if you gave them aid...<br />

          <br />If you can find the Witch's final resting place, rouse her from her millennial sleep and witness the paragon of wrath. She is shielded by dark magic, to old and arcane to penetrate.
          Purify her soul, and give her the eternal sleep she so violently desires. <br />

		  With the creation of the Sanctuary by the angel Inarius and demoness Lilith, the demons and angels who wanted to avoid the Great Conflict between the High Heavens and Pits of the Burning Hells came with them and settled it. The first humans were created as their offspring by mixing the demonic and angelic &ndash; the Nephalem. At first they seemed to be nothing like their parent, but quickly it became evident that they wield latent magical powers possibly even greater than their ancestors. Finding this out, Inarius decided to kill them all, but Lilith wanted to make an army to fight the Heaven and Hell. They began fighting, and Lilith, defeated, was banished into the Void &ndash; an utterly empty and black space, a prison for various beings &ndash; to be eternally trapped there.
          </p>

		   <p class="content">Rathma, their son, had avoided the slaughter that followed, and became the servant and student of a mystical <span style="white-space:nowrap;">dragon-guardian</span> of the Sanctuary &ndash; Trag'Oul. After a thousand years, Lilith escaped the Void in the middle of the Sin War events, faming Uldyssian and making him fight the Triune and various related demons with his companions - one of them being Mendeln, his brother. Rathma took in Mendeln, and trained him as his apprentice &ndash; the two of them being the first Necromancers, following the teachings of Trag'Oul.</p>

		   <p class="content">Eventually, Rathma was found and sent to the Void by Inarius, but Trag'Oul sent Mendeln to retrieve Rathma at a great risk. Before the end of the Sin War, Lilith, too, was sent to the Void again, by Inarius. Uldyssian, defeating Inarius, now literally <i>stopped</i> and banished the angels and demons single-handedly &ndash; finishing the Sin War. Trying to restore the Sanctuary to it's previous state, he took in all the destruction and damage it suffered during this war, and was guided by Trag'Oul to the Void to release it.</p>

		   <p class="content">After these events, Rathma and others pleaded with the Heavens and Hells to spare Sanctuary and the humans. Finally a deal was struck to keep Sanctuary and humanity in existance &ndash; with no war on either side allowed there.</p>

          <p class="content"><b>Enemies</b><br />
