								<br />This uberlevel is a recreation of the city of Kurast located at the Kehjistani frontier, 3000 years before the birth of the prophet Akarat and during the Mage Clan Wars between the Ennead, Annuit and Vizjerei clans. Kurast, a neutral town allied with
								the Taan, was seized by the Ennead and used as a necromantic military outpost. Can you destroy the magical fortifications and liberate the town?</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />The town is well defended by armies of skeletons undead. Around the town square you will find the Ennead shadowgate totems, which periodically raise additional skeletons and emit a magical field that grants invulnerability to nearby units. The necromantic
								army is tended to by a contingent of Ennead Necromancers.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Bosses</b>

							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />The place where angels watch, once the staging ground of the heavenly host for their crusades into the abyss, is an underground cave miraculously illuminated by sunlight. When the holy legions were defeated and forced out of the dimension by the forces
								of Hell, a few human worshippers remained behind to stand vigil. But heavenly magic is too powerful for mortals to tolerate for long. The mutated, wretched remains of the human defenders were found and embraced by the mighty Lucion, son of Mephisto.</p>
							<p
							class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />The Island is defended by the demented priests and their escorts of warrior nuns. The nuns wield holy weapons which grant them divine invulnerability if they keep attacking, while the priests conjure the holy spirit in the form of a slow moving wraith
								projectile which should be avoided at all costs. Near them are Lucion's overseers, the Feyrs, and their unholy Nightmare curse.</p>
								<p class="content"><b>Bosses</b>
									<br />A short distance from the entrance is Lucion's high priest, Malic, wielding fire spells and a deadly homing chaos bolt. Lucion himself has a powerful poison attack, 50% resistance to all damage and emits an unholy aura that makes nearby enemies invulnerable.</p>

								<br />Heaven. Nirvana. Celestia. Call it what you will. Home of the heavenly host, which almost destroyed the taint on creation that is the mortal plane twice and allowed it to get overrun by the forces of Hell. Far from being the beings of love they are believed
								to be by the common folk, the angels of the High Heavens present a clear and present danger to Sanctuary. It may be better to strike first.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />Ethereals are the physical manifestations of common angels. They attack furiously, but when you kill one of them, it shatters, reducing all resistances of other nearby enemies to -100% but inspiring them with righteous zeal. The glowing Orbitals and
								the Lightwell gargoyles with their deadly poison bolts are impossible for mortals to destroy and should best be avoided. Keep a close eye on the health of your minions: the death of a minion releases its soul to heaven, healing all Ethereals and Avatars.
								Casting Nightmare or deploying a Void Archon nearby will stop this healing.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Bosses</b>
								<br />Zakarum's Avatars watch over the battle on wings of light. They are divine and immortal, but when an Ethereal dies nearby, the backlash temporarily makes them vulnerable, reducing all resistances to 0%. Strike while it lasts, and strike several times,

							<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>

							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />After the destruction of the Prime Evils, a new era of peace and prosperity began, eventually evolving into what we call the modern age. Humanity has all but forgotten how to deal with demons. Until out of nowhere an evil force beneath the metropolis
								of Fauztinville begins to corrupt the machinery and pets, turning them against their masters. Overwhelmed by the assault, the army employs its new experimental time machine to request help from the heroes of the past. Will you answer the call?</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />Fauztinville has fallen under an onslaught of demonically twisted robots and demons bursting from the city's neon signs. Each battle should be straightforward, but beware their various immunities, notably the tri-elemental immunities of Neon Fiends.
								Summoners should eliminate Harpylisks first to prevent their bouncing blade attack from ravaging their forces.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Bosses</b>
								<br />The invasion is led by five warped robots, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon. Find them in the back alleys of Fauztinville and terminate them. If you have trouble finding them, look for dead-end streets and hidden passages through buildings. One
								of the five requires a teleport skill to access; if you do not have a teleportation spell, use an item with charges of Blink or Jitan's Gate, like the runeword Pax Mystica or the reward charm for the Lord Aldric Jitan uberquest.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Reward</b>
								<br />Fauztinville (and Yshari Sanctum) on Destruction difficulty is the only place where you can find the following three Great Runes. These runes are required for the most powerful runewords and their chance to drop ratio is 3:2:1, from first to last.</p>

								<br />The Triune (Act 1: Cathedral)</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />The White Temple of the Cult of the Triune. The symbol of the trinity is pervasive throughout their rank and architecture, inspired by their patron saints: Dialon, Bala and Mefis. In truth, these saints of love and beauty were the three Prime Evils wearing a guise of peace, but only the High Priests and Bishop-Templars knew the truth, slowly spreading the Three's corruption through the church and its servants. Each saint had a Bishop-Templar vouchsafing her aspect. Gulag the Black Inquisitor, for Bala. Drider-King Astrogha, for Dialon. And Lucion, Mephisto's own son, for Mefis. </p>

								<p class="content">Uldyssian ul-Diomed broke the Templars' armies on the battlefield in his campaign to obliterate the Triune and the Cathedral of Light, even managing to destroy Gulag. Astrogha escaped to some shadowy realm, but Lucion elected to remain, hoping to corrupt Uldyssian. The Son of Hatred sent the High Priest Malic to treat with Uldyssian, but the Edyrem King knew better than to listen. Uldyssian ul-Diomed met Lucion and Malic on the field of battle and banished them, but not before the demon and his priest slew Achillios, the Sword-Corporal of the Edyrem, and Uldyssian's closest friend.</p>

								<p class="content">A war of subterfuge erupted following the Edyrem's campaign. With Gulag slain and Lucion and High Priest Malic banished from Sanctuary, Astrogha sought to fill the power vacuum. High Priest Primus had strangely disappeared in the late years of the war, so Astrogha took on that guise and sent High Priest Arihan, along with a troop of Peace Warders, Que-Hagan priests, and Morlu, to try and dispatch of Uldyssian once and for all. Again, the armies were dispersed and the great demons banished.</p>

								<p class="content">But where Lucion and Malic had failed, and where Astrogha and Arihan had failed, Lilith had succeeded. Lilith, the Mother of Sanctuary, finally corrupted Uldyssian, and thereafter the Dark Edyrem sealed themselves away. Lilith reestablished the Triune and installed Arihan as the sole High Priest. However, and fortunately for the forces of light, it is said that an aspect of Primus haunts the great temple halls of the Triune, seeking revenge for his usurpation by Arihan. </p>

								<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />The Triune is defended by a host of powerful constructs and revenants: the ghastly Impaler Archons spitting beams of white-hot energy, the cold Kraken Guards, who will haunt their own dying grounds. The homuncular Primal Clays, and the flaming-but-static Temple Spires which rain down destruction all around them. <!--		Impaler Archon (Archon), Kraken Guard (Harpy),  Primal Clay (Clay Golem), Temple Sire (Totem)--></p>
								<p class="content"><b>Boss</b>
								<br />To defeat Arihan, High Priest of the Triune, you must find a way to convince him to fight Primus' Messenger, a strange being sent by Drider-King Astrogha. There are rumors of an even queerer creature possessed by the demon-of-deceit Lilith, that could hold the key... <br /></p>
								<p class="content"><b>Cycles</b>
								<br />The Triune on Destruction difficulty is the only place where you can find <span class="orange">Cycles</span>. There are 9 different <span class="orange">Cycles</span> and most of them come in three sizes, with each larger size being more powerful. You can keep more than one of the same kind of <span class="orange">Cycles</span> in your inventory.</p>

								guarding the area until you reach the king, Terul. After you follow one of the two corridors, you will find a small spot where he is located. Terul is pretty simple, and it's meant to be that way. He is simply poison and physical immune, and despite his high

								<br />Spider Cavern (Act 3: Spider Forest)</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />Valthek, a powerful mage of the Vizjerei Brotherhood has built a giant Empire, to reign for the rest of the days, and to serve him as a strong defense for anyone trying to steal the Ancient Repositories, which shall never be obtained by mortals. For
								this, he built his own Reign, the Yshari Sanctum. This gigantic maze is split in several stages with different powerful creatures. This subterranean dimension is guarded by the Prime Evils: You will need to face each one of them before you can destroy the
								Seal of the Gods, where Valthek is being protected, in order to keep the Ancient Repositories safe. Accessing them will reward any warrior greatly by enchanting his abilities.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />There are numerous powerful monsters throughout the maze that will test your battle prowess and running speed to the limit. You must be well versed in the various deadly arts and damage types to even think of venturing far into the maze.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Boss</b>
								<br />Each stage will have a special boss, protected by several smaller bosses that also appear on the specific stage. You have to find them, they are located in special 'boss areas' hidden in the maze. Each boss might drop a set piece of the Brotherhood
								of the Vizjerei. Their fellow guardians will also have a bias to drop set parts of the Horadrim set. This means, you will need to obtain the 5 set pieces of each boss, and the 5 set pieces of their guardians, in order to be able to fight the last boss,
								Valthek. Each boss and minion has a chance to drop only their own set piece. While wearing the two sets simultaneously, you will be granted with new very powerful skills which are required to defeat Valthek, the Vizjerei Sorcerer.</p>

								<br />Maggot Lair (Act 2: Far Oasis)</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />Travelers say that humongous insect monsters lie in this lair, infused with ancient magic present in these desolated lands, drawn by the small oasis in the desert. It is said that at the end of the lair, a terrible magical abomination has made it's nest.</p>
							<p
							class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />On the first level, there are two types of monsters. Sand Maggot Eggs will spawn young Ghost Worms which are untargetable and will use a deadly poison attack, while the Eggs will prevent your heal. In other words, you just have to run like crazy and
								avoid dying, and get high poison resistances, because you cannot use potions.
								<br />The second level features no untargetable worms. You will be fighting Mothers, Eggs, Young Worms and Snakes. Once again, defense and poison resistances will be very handy here. You also need to have a decent kill-speed, because these worms will reproduce
								very fast.
								<br />The third level is a headache. It has a mix of all the previous mentioned monsters, except the ones that prevent your heal. In other words, this is like level 2, but there will always be some Ghost Worms left, meaning you need both huge killspeed and
								defense. Before fighting the boss, you might want to lure those Ghost Worms away so they don't bother you much.</p>
								<p class="content"><b>Boss</b>
									<br />Brachyceran will used ranged attacks and magic to try to kill you or drive you away. He has five different attacks.
									<br />A nova of barrels that explode on impact dealing high fire damage.
									<br />A Burning Orb (nova), but with red punishers dealing fire damage. It's Deadly at close range, with timered casts.
									<br />He will throw poison seeds that leave behind a cloud of poison for a short while.
									<br />The last attack is 6 Lorenados, dealing poison damage.
									<br />He will try to turn you into a young worm, lowering your max fire resistances and slowing you, making you highly vulnerable to Barrel Nova or Burning Orb - it lasts 2 seconds, and is timered as well.</p>

								invulnerability rune. Find a way to kill him before he takes over the world.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Enemies</b>
								<br />The possessed citizens and their Necromorb overseers are straightforward battles, but beware the ones that rush at you with lit powder kegs! They can throw the kegs over large distances and then light the fuse, which will burn down towards the keg and
								cause a devastating explosion that is almost always fatal to nearby adventurers.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Bosses</b>
								<br />Assur wields powerful fire magic, but his main threat is the invulnerability shield. It is impossible to damage Assur directly. You will have to wrestle the secret to destroy Assur from his henchmen.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>The secret</b>
								<br />Retrieve the five demon seals from Assur's lieutenants: Skinrender, Spinecracker, Eyegouger, Fleshcutter and Bonehexer. On Destruction difficulty, each lieutenant drops his own seal.
