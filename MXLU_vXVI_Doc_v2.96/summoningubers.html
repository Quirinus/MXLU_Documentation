								in the first place. Like a Hellcat playing with a mouse, the Butcher may reveal his one weakness if you can take enough pain to convince him you are no threat... let him hit you and there is a chance (20% on attack) a glowing bright red pentragram will appear. Lure him

								<br />Act 3: Kurast Causeway</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />The church of Zakarum is highly ritualistic. One of the grand Zakarumite ceremonies involves the summoning and ritual crucifixion of the living spirit of the prophet Akarat by the church fathers of Travincal, four times a year or in times of trouble.
								These are certainly troubled times, but there is no telling if the ritual may be affected by the corruption that has tainted the temple city...</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
								<br />The corrupted spirit of Akarat is protected by heavenly invulnerability and is impossible to attack directly. Remember that a religion is nothing without followers and attack his twelve apostles first. The death of one of his apostles unleashes a wave
								of holy energy, reducing all resistances of other apostles to -100% and breaking the immunity shield of Akarat himself, reducing all resistances to 0% for a few precious seconds. This does however enrage them and they will attack you with renewed vigour.
								Killing an apostle may be difficult due to the mass healing spell they cast when low on health, as well as the storm of magical hammers with which they pummel you from a distance and their ability to heal when they slay a minion or hero. If you have access
								to Nightmare or a Void Archon, use it to shut down their healing. Akarat himself is blessed in another way as well: the spirits of the Light repel a percentage of all incoming attacks.</p>

								<br />
								<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
									<br />When Uldyssian sacrificed his life at the Cathedral of Vanity in the battle between angels and demons, his soul was thought to be blown to the far reaches of the universe. But a malicious spirit in the High Heavens, watching over the battle from afar,
									snatched Uldyssian and his edyrem on their way to oblivion. Imperius, archangel and high warlord of the Crystal Arch, had his own opinions about Sanctuary and the human vermin inhabiting it. This taint on creation had to be eradicated. But his side of
									the argument, despite the support of Malthael, lost out in the Angiris Council due to the intervention of Tyrael, and the ensuing blood pact with Mephisto prevented him from intervening on the mortal plane at all. A puppet had to be found, and Uldyssian
									was just what he sought. After a thorough brainwashing, Imperius sent his harbinger Dark Uldyssian to Sanctuary with the mission to exact divine justice and destroy the world...</p>
								<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
									<br />Dark Uldyssian and his Fallen Edyrem exist only partially on the mortal plane and cannot be hit by mortals. When Dark Uldyssian hits a player or minion, an avatar of Imperius or Malthael may be summoned (1% chance) to interfere directly with the battle and this
									avatar is vulnerable to attack. The Fallen Edyrem do not have this power, but you can tell apart Dark Uldyssian by his heavy armour. Both Avatars can throw alchemical holy hand grenades packing the power of creation itself, summon homing magical bolts
									and summon more Fallen Edyrem at a rapid rate.</p>

							<p class="content">Once you enter, you cannot go back trough the stairs.</p>

							<p class="content"><b>Lore</b>
								<br />Zorun Tzin is a powerful mage from Khejan that was sent to discover more about the Edyrem and their powers. He was jealous of them for having these immense powers from birth, as opposed to him having to study a lifetime to acquire them. Out of spite, Zorun crafted a scheme to get hold of Uldyssian, the ruler of the Edyrem. With his giant servant Terul travelling north to Harrogath for reasons unknown to Zorun, the Kejanese mage took matters into his own hands. He ambushed a caravan traveling through Kurast which he knew to contain Uldyissian, taking him as captive. Before he could thoroughly interrogate the powerful Edyrem, his servant Terul returned, under the possession spell of Malic. Malic, one of the last human defenders of the Island of the Sunless Sea, had caught wind of the powerful Zorun Tzin years upon years ago. The arrival of Terul to the northern lands proved as Malic's chance to finally conquer the mage. Terul, under Malic's spell, attempted to kill Uldyssian. After a brual battle, Uldyssian defeated Malic but was swiftly dying after the battle concluded. With his last breath he possessed Zorun Tzin, thus killing him.</p>
							<p class="content">See <a href="levelubers.html#unformed" target="_self">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about Terul.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
								<br />Zorun has a Heroic Shield and will pounce on you as soon as he sees you. This triggers off a devastating six-directional projectile spell which is countered by staying in his melee range.
								<br />
								<br />Zorun's powers aren't restricted by range. Staying in his face will not be so easy because of his Spine attack. It deals no damage by itself but it summons untargetable, high physical damage dealing ratfinks whose job is to get you on the run, hence making you susceptible to the above instakill spell.
								<br />
								<br />His last ability is to spawn statues that grant him a large invulnerability area. Use the Purify spell obtained from either <a href="dungeonubers.html#uldy" target="_self">Uldyssian's Sword</a> or <a href="levelubers.html#dunc" target="_self">Assur's Bane</a>.
								<br />
								<br />Stay on your toes and use the terrain of the Hidden Fortress to your advantage to manage the ratfinks and clear statues while damaging the boss.</P>

								<br />There are many religions in Sanctuary. Although they all tell very different stories, loremasters agree that since most of them seem to be effective and enable their faithful to work miracles, there has to be a common truth between them. One particular
								element found in most religions is the creation of the world by a God or other deity, whether it be Anu, the Earthfather and Skymother or even Tiarna Dulra. Some even believe that the world as we know it was shaped by an individual human on another plane,
								one 'Brother Laz' with a calculation engine powered by lightning. According to this cult, when humanity complains too much about the difficult living conditions in Sanctuary and the scarcity of divine weaponry, he may send his avatar to the mortal plane
								to deal with those who annoy him in person...</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
								<br />The Groupies are just your average frenzied fanbois with throwing knives and should not be too hard to dispatch despite their tri-elemental attack. The boss, Brother Laz, is at a whole different level. Do not stand still in his crosshairs or he will
								cast either Deathstrike or Singularity on you and annihilate you. If you keep moving, he will attempt an offensive teleport, summon more minions and may cast totems that kill you if you go near them. Do not destroy the totems: they will unleash wild magic
								that renders you brittle as glass and heals Brother Laz and his Groupies. Using his leet hax0r powers, Brother Laz is invulnerable to any damage and this time there is no loophole or weakness. Use the <i>Purify</i> skill you acquired in Duncraig and keep
								hitting the power tripping modmaker with it until he dies.</P>

								<br />In his vanity, fallen angel Inarius made the fatal mistake of raiding one of Mephisto's black temples on mortal soil and killing the dark monks there. The Prime Evils had previously ignored this rebellious angel, but this was an insult they could not
								leave unpunished. Mephisto invaded Inarius' cathedral of vanity, burned it to the ground and captured Inarius and his followers, warping and mutating them into flabby and horrible creatures - the Overlords - instilling them with eternal hatred for the
								still beautiful creations of Zakarum, humans. You may be able to summon Inarius' ghost at a place of great significance for the fallen angel...</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
								<br />Unknown<!--Even in their weakened state, Inarius' ghost and his minions hit very hard and almost always hit. Even in death, Inarius' followers protect him with their own spirits, granting Inarius invulnerability until the last of the followers are dead. Keep moving
								because his minions will attack you with Deathstrike with their dying breath. The tough Overlords have 50% all resistances, and Inarius' angelic heritage additionally grants him the ability to ignore a percentage of all attacks. Despite all this, the

								<br />It is said that Diablo can possess anyone if they have the key to his soul by slowly corrupting and twisting them until they break.</p>
							<p class="content"><b>Strategy</b>
								<br />There are two monsters, Diablo Clone and Minions of Terror. Minions of Terror are harmless looking <i>zombies</i>, these undead creatures are slow walking and pretty dumb.
								<br />Beware of Diablo Clone, he has a Heroic Shield, is immune to Fire and Poison, has health regeneration and is extremely resilient when his life is low and in danger - requiring a very wise aproach to killing him. Your avoiding skills and killspeed need to be elevated for this uberquest! His skills are not hard to notice. His main source of damage comes from weapon and physical damages. He will try to knock you away and make you burn in flames, while randomly blinking on top of you to hit you on melee strikes. His spells are no instagibs, so surviving him is not a big problem. However, he will use two different skills when damaged. The first one, will summon a minion. The second one, will buff all his close minions, giving them huge speed, attack rate and flat fire damage, so if you see his minions becoming red, you better start running! On death, he will enhance all his minions giving them his form, and huge speed, in order to prevent you from looting the reward.</p>
