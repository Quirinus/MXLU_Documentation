<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Gharbad the Weak</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Night Clan (melee version).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Spider Cavern.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong, Cursed.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts (self only) Frenzy on striking, curses (-50% physical resistance) on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Doomweaver outraged and left Hell when he heard he wouldn&#8217;t be reallocated in his dear Spider Cavern. It&#8217;s said that years later, he actually started a cult of spider worshipers and goatmen haters. He called it... communism, or something.<br />
Let&#8217;s face it. Everybody hates you, Gharbad. Go find a fire and die in it.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~7 Night Clan (melee version).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They call him <strong>the Weak</strong>, and they&#8217;re not trying to deceive you but stating that he&#8217;s weak. Very weak.<br />
I mean, the Extra Strong + Cursed thing on a melee monster with melee followers should work pretty well. But no, he really sucks like there was no tomorrow.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Deathspit</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Poison Spitter.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The World Nexus (aka, &#8220;I like labyrinths&#8221; &#8211;Laz)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Mana Burn.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, Poison Sputter (actually, that skill&#8217;s name is Acid Blast, but however, PS is much more win).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> To understand the origins of this creature and his followers, you should take the name literally. One day, Rathma was walking around a forest and spitted on the ground. Then time passed, and these things happened to coagulate from the sputter &#8220;of Death&#8221; :P.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Poison Spitters, all of them Extra Fast.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Come on. They&#8217;re just fast spitter rats, summon a cat and make them flee in terror.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">The Vizier</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Dark Cabalist.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Flayer Jungle, next to the entrance to Kurast.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Mana Burn, Stone Skin.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Venomous Spirit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Assasinated years ago by Jehryn&#8217;s guardsmen, the corpse of the Ruler of the Desert was recued from being devoured by alligators by a tribe of pigmy fighters, who took him as their Messiah. With effort and time, they took him back to their native Kurast Swamps.<br />
Then, by sacrificing the souls of their priests, they infused new life into the dead body of the fallen Lord.<br />
Nothing happened for six days, but when the small creatures were about of committing mass suicide, the Vizier rose and walked again. Slowly, he opened his rot eyes and chuckled a prayer to his pagan gods:<br />
&#8220;Democrazy doesn&#8217;t work... I shall crush capitalism... Democrazy doesn&#8217;t work...&#8221;<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~5 Dark Cabalists.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> With poison resistance, you can dance in their VS forever, without it, you have to move every now and then. But you really should have maxed resitances by now.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Goldblight of the Flame</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Dark Archon.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The Unformed Land.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Cold Enchanted<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, War Spirit (casts spike novas when an enemy is close), Casts Thunder Hammer and Thunder Wave and curses (-50% physical resistance) and slows you on striking. Also casts Glacial Nova on death. Invisibility.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The other member of the De-blight-ful duo. He left when he realized the Blightfire was suposed to be a pack leader but actually had no minions. That sucked. Heaps.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~4  Dark Templars.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> No big deal, actually. The freeze effect is annoying, but his hammers can be avoided/outranged if you&#8217;re a ranged character, and if you&#8217;re not, simply rushing to him should do.<br />
Summoners should get rid of his Templars themselves, though. Then their zerg rush won&#8217;t have any problem surrounding and eating him.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Nightwing the Cold</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Familiar.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Ruined Tample (the one where the Tome of Lam Esen spawns).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Cold Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical/lightning attack, casts Zigzagging Multiple Bolts on striking. Freezes on striking, casts Glacial Nova on death. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Is allergic to heat, flowers, good and rabbits.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~12 Extra Fast Familiars.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They&#8217;re not a real problem, even though you should have maxed lightning resistance to tank the lightning bolts, they pierce, and I suspect them to have no ND.<br />
Ranging them isn&#8217;t fully possible, since they will rush to you and catch after the first hit, but again, their damage isn&#8217;t so outstanding. Just get rid of the boss first, to stop the somewhat annoying cold effect.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Lachdanan</span></strong></span> <em>Council Leader</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Twilight Archon. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Travincal.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Magic.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong, Cursed.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Thunder Hammer, casts Thunder Wave. War Spirit (blasts Spike Novas when close to enemies). Curses on striking. <br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Even though his sudden humor changes and spikeblasts still make him be one of the most popular bosses, it&#8217;s not been the same since he lost his &#8220;Join Us&#8221; aura... That was a particularly hard blow.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~5 Twilight Templars.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> To beat the three Council Members, you should clear the large area completely, really, not having monsters trying to bite your ass actually helps. A lot.<br />
Now that&#8217;s clear, let&#8217;s take a look at Lachdnan himself. He has a pretty aggresive AI, meaning he&#8217;ll rush to you pretty often. But there&#8217;s a flaw with that, when he&#8217;s at melee range, he won&#8217;t attack you unless you hit him first. An eye for an eye.<br />
However, don&#8217;t party yet, because his minions will go on attacking you and his Spike Novas will go on happening as usual.<br />
Also, he&#8217;ll flee from you at low health.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Zhar the Mad</span></strong></span> <em>Is MaD!</em><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Undead Counselor.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Travincal.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Magic Resistant, Spectral Hit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical/spectral attack. Casts Elemental (old autotargeting version).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;I dunno if you&#8217;re high and/or hallucinating. But NO WAY I&#8217;M NOT KICKING YOUR ASS, B*TCH!&#8221; *jumps down from his helicopter, ready to kill*.&#8221; &#8211;Acid Visions.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~5 Undead Counselors, all of them shoot Elementals.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You&#8217;re facing a single element user enemy next to the end of Act 3, and you should have maxed resistances since you started it. Well, be how it be, the fire damage won&#8217;t be a problem, so unless a helicopter appears in your screen and he 1HKOs you with a deadly Sonic Slap, no big deal. :P</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Deathshade Fleshmaul</span></strong></span> <em>...&#8220;Immabanana!&#8221;</em> <strong>:]</strong><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Night Clan (Priest) .<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Travincal.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cold Enchanted, Teleportation.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Pain Spirit, Explodes his minion&#8217;s corpses, has passive Bacchanalia. Casts Glacial Nova on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> ...See? This is what happens when you let any random nooblar take part in contests to be a new SU boss.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Night Clan (Melee).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> &#8220;Gah bleh sputter&#8221; &#8211;Laz.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Gorestone</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Dark Toad.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Durance of Hatred, Level 3 (&#8220;You&#8217;re getting there...&#8221;)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Mana Burn.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Magic Missiles (two), melee stunning attack, casts Arcane Fury on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> This is what you get after mixing a bloodstone, an onyx and a splatstone. Some say he&#8217;s heaps fun, though.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Extra Fast Dark Toads.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> They won&#8217;t start attacking you until you get to &#8220;their zone&#8221;, also there are (usually) several types of undead knights that can either slow you down or curse you waiting before them. Lure those random mobs to the entrance an kill them. <br />
Now you should get closer to Gorestone and his pack and drag them close to the entrance too. Their damage per missile is pretty high (because you can&#8217;t resist it easily), so keep moving around to avoid it, dodging Magic Missiles has never been rocket science, though.<br />
As for the melee damage, it&#8217;s high, but they still attack pretty slow. Watch out for Magic Missiles sniping you while you fight in melee, though.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Bloodmoon Soulfire</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Geomancess.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Durance of Hatred, Level 3 (&#8220;Abandon your foolish quest&#8221;...)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Magic Resistant.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Fanaticism aura (buffs weapon damage), ranged fire attack, casts Mark of the Wild on striking. Volcano death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Emo cat.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~6 Extra Fast Infernal Lynx.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> You have chosen the way of defense. Basically, with enough defense to protect you from the lousy damage of javelins, you won&#8217;t have any problem. Even though, of course, I advice to clean the area of annoying monsters first.</p>

<p>Be how it be, do not rush to Mephisto yet, you have something else to do.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Bilefroth the Pit Master</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Tainted Soul.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Durance of Hatred, Level 3 (&#8220;Mortal... got Ice?&#8221;)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Cold Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts single target Frozen Soul, curses (-50% physical resistance) on damaging. Casts Glacial Nova on death.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> &#8220;And then I&#8217;ll train you as snipers to kill my unsuspecting enemies and I&#8217;ll rule the world! Lol!&#8221; &#8211;Mephisto, to the chilling abominations.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~9 Tainted Souls.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Yeah, killing the cats is way easier, so why even bothering with this one? You&#8217;ll see, their awareness range is huge, their attack range is huge and the damage they can pack against a hero locked in melee (even with maxed resistances) is HUGE.<br />
On top, Billy will curse you as soon as he touches you, making it even harder to survive against melee enemies.<br />
Hence, cowboy up and kill them before paying ole Meph a visit. They&#8217;re not too tough  by themselves.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;"> Mephisto </span></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 12px;">Prime Evil:<em> Lord of Hatred</em> </span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Mephisto.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Durance of Hatred, Level 3.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Organizing this one too:</p>

<p>-Nova Charge: Spawns Supernovas when an enemy is close. This little thing has no ND and hence is likely to be kickass.</p>

<p>-Countdown: Creates a small &#8220;mark&#8221; of ice on your head, then after two seconds it explodes in a rain of frost. This one does seem to deal less damage if you stand still on it than if you try to run across the waves of ice. Freezes.</p>

<p>-Winter Avatar: Avatar appears and Mephisto laughs like a maniac, then a lot of Frost Novas wipe the place. Freezes too.</p>

<p>-Monster Spawn: He basically spawns (on you) any monster that would normally spawn in the Durance (Level 3). That includes all types of Undead Knights, Twilight Archons and others. However, it also includes Death Knights, Que-Hegans (with their Peace Warders) and Heretics (yeah! :P).</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> <em>If at first you don&#8217;t succed, failure may be your style.</em><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> There&#8217;s always a Que-Hegan by his side since the beginning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Aaah, Mephisto...<br />
I don&#8217;t really understand why so many people find him so absolutely, totally and utterly indestructible and 1HKOer.<br />
You&#8217;ll see, you should have the path behind of you completely clear before going any close to him. Then, simply advancing a little in his &#8220;sanctum&#8221; will make the vicious demon rush after you. Blindly, he&#8217;ll follow you everywhere. Whithout even casting Nova Charge most of times. <strong>Run</strong>, and even with your suxy speed he won&#8217;t catch you.<br />
The entrance to the Durance is usually the best place to kill him if you have personal problems with TPs or simply don&#8217;t want to die ever because <em>that sucks, kthx.</em></p>

<p>Well, you know where to cheese him, now there they go a bunch of tips so that you don&#8217;t fail. At least, not epically:</p>

<p>-Max out your resistances, in case you haven&#8217;t yet. The only one that could be optional is fire. The other ones are a total must.</p>

<p>- This is likely to be a slow fight. And I mean literally slow, melee swings will take years to hit, moving will make you feel like a snail. There are two ways of fighting this: Get faster (aka= increase all of your speeds, even at cost of damage iself) or become immune to freeze.<br />
The latter option can only be used on Terror/Destruction, since the shield runeword with that effect requires a clvl of 63. I&#8217;m talking about the Goddess (Ber) Runeword.<br />
Also the Slow effect from Peace Warders cannot be fought in any way.</p>

<p>- Minions and reanimates: The more, the merrier.. not. Don&#8217;t give reanimates a priority. A lolminion should be used as distraction from time to time, though.</p>

<p>- Remember, you want to kill Mephisto, not his underlings. Focus all your firepower on him as often as you can. For casters, AoE spells (like Flamestrike, Hailstorm, etc) have proven to be better than directional ones most of times.</p>

<p>- Monsters. He spawns them almost constantly, but you shouldn&#8217;t care too much about them unless they have special effects (Death Knights, slowing undeads...) or are specially kickass (Que-Hegans, Heretics...). You can find detailed info about them in the Bestiary.</p>

<p>If he happens to summon any of those, quickly drop a lolminion between you and them and flee. Meph. will follow you.</p>

<p>- Also, at low health he&#8217;ll go &#8220;defensive&#8221; and flee from you, possibly over the pits, where you can&#8217;t follow him. No big deal, run away from him and he&#8217;ll follow you in a few seconds.</p>

<p>-By the way, in case you kill him over the pits, he won&#8217;t drop the soulstone. Yet once you cross the portal to Pandemonium it will magically appear in your inventory. Rocks, eh? :P</ul></p>
