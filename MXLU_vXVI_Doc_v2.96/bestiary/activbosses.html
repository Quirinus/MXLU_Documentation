<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Izual</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Izual.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> Plains of Despair.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Cold.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical stunning attack, casts Hailstorm.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Had a crush on a cold sorc decades ago, he&#8217;s still obsessed about it today:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiOujYl2TjM" target="_blank"><em>&#8220;You belong to me<br />
My snow white queen<br />
There's nowhere to run<br />
So let's just get it over<br />
Soon I know you'll see<br />
You're just like me<br />
Don't scream anymore my love<br />
'cause all I want is you.&#8221;</em></a><br />
 &#8211;Evanescence.</p>

<p>The fun thing, which he hasn&#8217;t realized of yet, is that it was a morphed paladin fooling around with Shadow Avatar. :P<br />
 <span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Izual, by himself, shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. Even though this is true of almost any boss, if you don&#8217;t rush too much and don&#8217;t bring random mobs with you, you should be fine:</p>

<p>One thing to watch out for: Hailstorm.<br />
That skill is just kickass, and it can kill you in seconds even with maxed cold resistance. However, it&#8217;s very avoidable, simply moving a few yards from it when he casts it should do. Also, lazy summoners who don&#8217;t want to resummon can just Blink (Pax Mystica) right behind of him, so that he doesn&#8217;t have time to cast it again and their summons escape the obliteration zone.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Hephasto the Armorer</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Smith (Overlord)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> River of Flame.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed. Spectral Hit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Bloodlust on striking, curses on striking.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Unlike in Larzuk&#8217;s case, the money demons pay to this guy for their weapons does line his pockets. In fact, there are a few odd facts with a bank account in Lagos, Nigeria...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Kill everything that could be following you. Scout the surroundings to slay any invisble enemy too.<br />
Done? Ok, now walk slowly in his place and get rid of any monster you see, you don&#8217;t want to get locked in melee with this guy casting Bloodlust and buffing your enemies to hell.<br />
Out of that, pretty simple, he&#8217;s mostly The Smith with more damage and HP. And now you have more space to plan your actions. On top of that, you (hopefully) have gotten a bit better at this business since then.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Sinwar of the Storm</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Moon Panzer- I mean Panther.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The Chaos Sanctuary.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Lightning Enchancted, Spectral Hit.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Mind Flay, spectral melee attack. Releases charged bolts when damaged<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> The leader, master and owner of any electrokitten that has ever lived. What she has done to increase her lightning power like that is simply beyond your mortal ken. And no, she&#8217;s not currently hiring.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~9 Moon Panthers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Mind Flay has a ND of 4 frames. That means that despite the &#8220;omglazorchain&#8221; looks deadly, it will deal the same damage as if a single one had hit you. That said, you should have no problem <em>at all</em>, ever.<br />
Not even summoners should. MF will hit a lot of their summons at once, but anyway the damage suxzors, so it can&#8217;t kill minions like that.</ul></p>

<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Guardian.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The Chaos Sanctuary (second upper seal).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Cursed, Fire Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee physical attack, casts Fire Splash on striking, curses (-50% physical resistance) on damaging.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Used to wear Vilehand, but then he realized that, in order to reduce foes to meat pieces, Visegrip would be much better.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~8 Guardians.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Not really needed, Guardians have never been a problem and as long as you&#8217;ve cleaned the place before summoning, they won&#8217;t be able of withstanding your OPness :P.</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Doomcloud</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Red Storm.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The Chaos Sanctuary (first lower seal).<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Lightning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Fast, Lightning Enchanted.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Casts Death Ray Epileptic Clone. Casts Static Trap on death, releases charged bolts when damaged.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Aka, the walking Mine Field! Tactical use only!<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~12 Extra Fast Red Storms.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Actually, you just need to have maxed out lightning resistance. Yep. And I&#8217;ll say again that you should have it maxed since Act 2.</p>

<p>I know you hate me :twisted:</ul></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Warlord of Blood</span></strong></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Minotaur.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home:</strong></span> The Chaos Sanctuary (central seal)<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Fire.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> Extra Strong, Magic Resistant.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Melee spectral attack, casts Time Strike on attack.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> Diablo secretly hates Bartuc, hence, in an act of mockery he picked a cow, gave it a mace and called him &#8220;Warlord of Blooood&#8221;.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> ~7 Minotaurs.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> Oh come on, it can&#8217;t be that hard to kill a bunch of ridiculous melee killermoos with ridiculously slow attack speed.</ul></p>

<p>(Now there really isn&#8217;t any more excesive blood here :P)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong><span style="color: #948870;">Diablo</span></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 12px;">Prime Evil: <em>Lord of Terror</em></span><br />
<ul><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Kind:</strong></span> Diablo.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Home</strong></span>... Sweet home...<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Immune to:</strong></span> Nothing.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Preset Unique modifier/s:</strong></span> None.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Skills:</strong></span> Organization ftw:</p>

<p>-Melee physical attack, it slows you down, btw.</p>

<p>-Flamestrike: <em>The</em> Flamestrike. With max fire resistance you don&#8217;t actually have to care about it.</p>

<p>-Bloodstorm: Places a trap, which shoots Blood Stars at enemies wihin range. Note that he casts it right on you, meaning that if you stand still it won&#8217;t shoot nor deal any damage.</p>

<p>-Blast Wave: Spell. Creates several stunning novas that knock back and deal physical damage.</p>

<p>-Monster spawn: Just like Mephisto and The Summoner, Diablo snaps his fingers and drops a random monster on your head. Note that he spawns several monsters on death too. Don&#8217;t let your guard down.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Comment:</strong></span> When the black abysm spawned the three brothers, the best raw materials were used to create Diablo&#8217;s body, as it was obvious he&#8217;d be the most popular one.<br />
Long time after that, each of those were used again in particularly powerful hellspawn:</p>

<p>-Charm -> Robert Redford.<br />
-Voice -> Dirty Harry.<br />
-&#8220;Lulz skeelz&#8221; -> Jim Carrey.<br />
-Win-fu -> Chuck Norris.<br />
-And of course, Clapton got the allmighty allmightiness. :)</p>

<p>And if you think Diablo&#8217;s comment should be better than this crap, I&#8217;m open to suggestions. :P</p>

<p>No, not really. You possibly suck too much to do it better than me. ;)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Minions:</strong></span> Spawns with a pack of Guardians.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11px;"><strong>Strategy:</strong></span> A lot of people find Diablo pretty easy, even nooblars. Are you telling me you are <em>worst</em> than nooblars? :O</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll scatter some random tips:</p>

<p>-Monsters: What you should do depends on what he summons. Suxy monsters like Guardians he spawns with should be ignored to focus you fire on him. But if he summons Elites or fingermages, destroy them asap.</p>

<p>-Melee fighting: Keep yourself at full health, even if BWs just deal 1K or two, heal anyway. It shouldn&#8217;t really be too difficult, just keep getting to him and chase him when he gets at low health.</p>

<p>-Ranged fighters: A destructive short ranged skill will be needed, since his mobs will appear right on you. Other than that, snipe him and don&#8217;t let him stack too many Bloodstorms on you. They won&#8217;t hurt af first, but if he KBs you with a BW, the lazorbeam will headshoot you despite of you max fire resistance.</p>

<p>-Summoners: Play an active role, your minions will be pretty slowed and will have difficulties harming him, but you can let them tank and pummel his HP down with some random spell of yours.</ul></p>
