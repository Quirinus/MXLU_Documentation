Median XL: Ultimative Documentation

===================================

Add to-do stuff here.

TO-DO (for everyone):
- [x] update median statue version in LC0
- [ ] maybe change "Level" --> "Area/Monster Level" on the uberquest pages, under the picture
- [ ] "check list.xlsx" (checking/comparing items from game (only items found in XVc, no legacy!) to the docs):
	- [ ] TU/SU/SSU/SSSU items: 17 missing (http://www.medianxl.com/t5619p1060-screenshot-thread#193998 http://www.medianxl.com/t6928p330-new-screenshot-items-2015#193999)
	- [ ] all set items need to be done
- [ ] include speedcalc. make a page for it in the items or char subsection, with marco's explanations, but a shorter version. provide a link to marcos explanations/dl.
- [x] maybe add http://www.medianxl.com/t86-how-spell-damage-works as a new page in concepts, but rewritten a bit?
- [ ] Change all non-tag < and > to &lt; and &gt;
- [ ] check if there's still 2 Linarian's Legacy enabled: one with +2 Life on Striking (the real one) and the other with 1% Reanimate as: Inarius (the legacy one enabled by mistake)... kinda hard to disapprove it without files.
- [ ] korcola: extract monster animations
- [ ] sigil of the 7 deadly sins color is darker than ring of pride, extract the right pic with colorshift/palshift
- [ ] for new rws/natasha and eternal, include the stats from runes in the rw stats (like normal rws have). check other elemental/great rune rws for this.
- [ ] Add links to some old/legacy docs to the doc, probably a new page under information. (http://www.medianxl.com/t4038-legacy-docs and the ones on the FTP location of the current docs)
- [ ] "Strength" is misspelled "Strenght" in Startled Witch under the "Legacy of Blood Trophy". and maybe somewhere else, check. (WolfieeifloW)
- [ ] Skillpoint Planner: change the link in its FAQ, under "Q: Can I use this tool offline?" to the doc's about page. "You can also download Full documentation in HTML format which includes this calculator, from the <about page| make this a link>."
- [ ] procs "on Attack", and other procs, add on hover explanation, similar to "when Attacked" and special class weapon procs like "Mega Impact".
- [ ] maybe add info under MXLU_vXVc_Doc_v2.95/runewords.html#staves about nerfed version of Ctc Lionheart on Ljosalf runeword. (Unda)
- [ ] Fleshbane rw: remove spaces between poison over time dmg numbers xxx - yyy should be xxx-yyy
- [ ] In the "Quest Reference" section the "Reward/Recipe" of the "Level Challenge 1" is wrong. (WolfieeifloW)
- [ ] Barb Windform to Poison Damage Explained: http://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?p=33760#p33760

TO-DO (for Quirinus):
- [ ] for all procs/oskills/skills, add a link to SB's [MXLDB] Skill Calculator, or even better, a hover: http://forum.median-xl.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1741
- [ ] for all procs/oskills/skills, add a span with class proc, skill, charge skill
- [ ] russian translation for skillpoint planner. files are in the skillpoint planner folder.
- [ ] Make all item/gem/etc. pictures PNG. Reorder the picture file paths to make more sense.
- [ ] update: docs --> Characters --> Item-Only Skills page. Use a script to collect oskills from the oskills list in the Items section. Make the script format them nicely, like they are now. I'll also probably have to ask marco for the cotw oskills. Then we just need to add in descriptions manually.
- [ ] Change: Make RW page in two columns; put name/level above properties, put rune description below that, and after that are the properties. Or something like that.
- [ ] Change: TU page: make the amulets/rings/jewels/quivers be in columns of 2 if the filter is set on any tier, except "All".
- [ ] Fix: Quest Reference list: difficulty headers not disappearing when the contents are empty.
- [ ] Add: Speed Calculator to the Characters (?) section, with explanations. http://www.medianxl.com/t5893-speed-mechanics-explained-updated-speedcalc
- [ ] remove anchors/links from menu when adding filter to the page http://goo.gl/fJc28a
- [ ] on sets page, make the image vertical-align: middle (should be centered relative to the stats text)
- [ ] script to make the oskills list into the char oskills with description (+add their ingame description from new skills.txt + tbls)
- [ ] fix hit causes monsters to flee % on all pages. check in the files (RW,TU,SU). hmmmmm fix or show the real value which is x*100/128% or floored value instead of x%
- [ ] Rare Affix Pool:
	Indestructible: affix now spawns in the correct group.
	Swords: now spawn with +druid skills.
	Druid Staves: +(21 to 28) to Gamma Field
	Scepters: wdm bonuses such as +min/max damage, %enhanced damage, etc. can now spawn.
- [ ] Scepters: fixed strength damage bonus appearing as a base affix.
- [ ] get base items from OT (then make the bg black with the script), these ones are too blurry
- [ ] quest ref, under void name it's thick line
- [ ] some items have negative stats listed as -(x to y) and others as (-x to -y). In some instances both can be found on one single item. (void http://www.medianxl.com/t3217p430-mxl-u-xiv-b-docs-v2-93#193048) - fix with regexp
- [ ] RW move include type to type column: http://www.medianxl.com/t6739p160-mxlu-xvc-docs-2-94-unfinished#192317
- [ ] adblock slows down docs loading
- [ ] fix great maul tu su ssu sssu pic, it's moved and cut off compared to the base item
- [ ] Unformed Land: elemental runes/unknown skull: they don't have the same chance to drop, skulls have 50% chance less to drop.
- [ ] Sangreal Xis rw: (125 to 25)% FHR & IAS --> (25 to 125)% (Stealthmaster)
- [ ] On Attack --> On Melee Attack change everywhere unless it messes up formatting because no space (like in the SU page maybe) (ShadowDawn)
- [x] quest reference list: remove char orb (Siosilvar)
- [ ] characters -> item only -> Pandemonium skill rename to Hellgate (Stealthmaster)
- [ ] Dajjal rw: +(5 to 5) Life on Striking --> +5 Life on Striking (Stealthmaster)
- [ ] Barb Shaman set with 4 items: +2 to Maximum Barbarian Minions --> 100% minion dmg (ChuckNoRis)
- [ ] Veteran Token: Clawstorm Terror - Catacombs 1-3 --> Jail 1-3 (Dakoon)

Suggestions:
- [ ] Claygame: Add a pic below every recipe showing what the ingredient look like, for example: minigame recepie have pic of cc and the rune below or beside the recipe text.
- [ ] Claygame: Instead of only having "see THIS PAGE for details" below descriptions, also make the key part of text as a direct link to the intended page.
- [ ] Claygame: Add pictures of Veteran monster of each act on the monster token page.
- [ ] Maybe somehow merge SU/SSU/SSSU and TU6 stuff so it can be more easily compared?
- [ ] Maybe add a link to the maps for the ubers that have it? Or add a note at the top of each uber page that the maps are available on Quest Reference page?
- [ ] Base items: maybe use regex to remove 0 from req str/dex/lvl?
- [ ] Add silver td border to RWs, base items and char orb, like in the rest of the pages?
- [ ] Add a list of monsters that drop each GR in Yshari. I guess I gotta ask Marco if I can do it.
- [ ] Claygame: Add pic of the armor/weapon type at the top of each section of RW page to let people know exactly what works for these RW?
- [ ] Change: Rune/RWs: Level --> Required Level?
- [ ] Base Items page: Maybe add a note that broken ethereal items cannot gain durability even if they have the 'repair xx durability in yy seconds' mod.
- [ ] Claygame: maybe add link to forum somehow in the About page that opens when docs r opened for the first time to make people come more often on forum?
- [ ] Add: skill tree names to skillpoint planner?
- [ ] Change: Make filters on all pages always float in vision (absolute pos)?
- [ ] SU page: remove the cross/title from items that have a special graphic?y
- [ ] Claygame: Check if all the RWs r up to date or they need to be checked from file and corrected.
- [ ] Claygame: add a 3rd column to the "Items with Oskill List" & "Items with procs list" and list the item name/type in that column instead of sticking it with item name. Quirinus: fix the css for it (3rd column), then use regexp to auto split the 2 columns into 3.
- [ ] Claygame:  Add t1-t6 pocs and skills in "proc/Oskill from items page" and made them as hovetext just like shield's block. (Q): or add a radio button: show all tiers, show only T6?
- [ ] gems and runes, bg/shadow: http://www.medianxl.com/t6774-poll-items-with-no-transparent-background#183234 , http://www.medianxl.com/t6739p70-mxlu-xvc-docs-2-94-unfinished#183051
- [ ] check if on hover images in the SU page are cached once they're first loaded. maybe make them all precache with a loop that places them in a hidden div.
- [ ] add maps from quest reference to main uber pages as well?
- [ ] maybe add on hover explanations for -% All Enemy Resistances, +% Spell Damage, +% All Resists?
- [ ] RequiemLux: When the documentation is opened up wouldn't be better to use the page "Introduction" instead of "About" to introduce someone to it? - implement or not? or just add a link to introduction and a short text
