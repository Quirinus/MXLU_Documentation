Median XL: Ultimative Documentation

===================================

Add to-do stuff here.

TO-DO:
- Fix (rish & quirinus): Any proc (and probably skill/oskill? check) rolls over after lvl 63. lvl 66 = 2. Check for all instaces of it and fix on all pages.
- Add: skill tree names to char pages
- Add: WUW abbreviation: what you want (for it), explain that it's used when trading, look at N NN O R abbr.
- Add: GS abbreviation
- Add: oskills from new sets and set items to the oskills list page
- Add: procs from new sets and set items to the procs list page
- Update: any proc/oskill change on any item on the oskills/procs list page
- Update: all character pages (partially done) and skillpoint planner
- Fix: - Docs > FAQs > LFAQ (Less FAQ) > *Area Guides (Spoilers)* > maps for Triune and Vizjun are not loading. I get 404 not found, probably just some links missing. (Metalistas)
- Add: Sin set weapon/shield have special graphic. Check the ss (ask quirinus or someone for it) and find the image on google/wikis or extract from mpq. Then put it in the right folder and apply it to the sets.html page.
- Remove: Diablo Clone. (from the page and from the menu)
- Add: Maybe include the socketed rune bonus in the RW stats (or make it toggleable).
- Add: Shield chance to block on all item pages (base+stat, for class-only add class base chance too).
- Change: Maybe make the "Uniques" node in the menu not open the TU page on click (make it just a normal book that opens the sub-sections).
- Fix: Area Effect Attack on mount arreat set should be orange.
- Fix: Make ([Class] Only) either white or red for all items/classes. Currently only Barbarian items have it as white, the rest have red.
- Change: Prefix/suffix list: Make calculators not reset the filter dropdowns/inputs.
- Change: Rename some of the areas that have changed names (uberquest pages, challenges, quest reference list and anywhere else that it might appear). Change their parent level names too if they're different.
- All other changes from the XV and XVc changelog. 

Suggestions:
- Suggestion (rishab/Claygame): Add a desc to tell that cc says "all trials completed" when all trials r done and hearts have not been cubed yet, idk coding so i cant do it.
- Suggestion (rishab/Claygame): Add a pic below every recepie showing what the ingredient look like, for example: minigame recepie have pic of cc and the rune below or beside the recepie text.
- Suggestion (rishab/claygame): Instead of having "see THIS PAGE for details" below descriptions, make the key part of text as a direct link to the intended page.
- Suggestion (rishab/claygame): Add pictures of Veteran monster of each act on the monster token page.

DONE:
- Pester Marco to explain in more detail about the new Amazon faster cast rate with staves and 2h weapons. Then update the note on the Amazon page if necessary.
