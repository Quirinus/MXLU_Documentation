Median XL: Ultimative Documentation

===================================

Add to-do stuff here.

TO-DO (those with no names are added by Quirinus):
- All is One full set bonus gives ctc lol 66 --> displayed 2. SSSU Short bow have +65 to OHMAN --> 62. SSSU spirit edge proc lvl 66 --> 2. check if those are just display rollovers/caps, or are they used to calculate the skill too.
 check if those are just display caps/rollovers or are they used to calculate the skill effects too.
- Add: skill tree names to char pages
- Add: oskills from new sets and set items to the oskills list page
- Add: procs from new sets and set items to the procs list page
- Update: any proc/oskill change on any item on the oskills/procs list page
- Update: Skillpoint planner
- Add: Sin set weapon/shield have special graphic. Check the ss (ask quirinus or someone for it) and find the image on google/wikis or extract from mpq. Then put it in the right folder and apply it to the sets.html page.
- Add: Maybe include the socketed rune bonus in the RW stats (or make it toggleable).
- Add: Shield chance to block on all item pages (base+stat, for class-only add class base chance too).
- Fix: Make ([Class] Only) either white or red for all items/classes. Currently only Barbarian items have it as white, the rest have red.(rish: if every other char have it as red.. make barb red too, will be easier and will look sexier. I did it for SU/TU/Sets page. If its fine then u can strike this Fix off this list)
- Change: Prefix/suffix list: Make calculators not reset the filter dropdowns/inputs.
- Change: Rename some of the areas that have changed names (uberquest pages, challenges, quest reference list and anywhere else that it might appear). Change their parent level names too if they're different.
- Change: Make RW page in two columns; put name/level above properties, put rune description below that, and after that are the properties. Or something like that.
- Change: Make filters on all pages always float in vision (absolute pos)?
- Change: TU page: make the amulets/rings/jewels/quivers be in columns of 2 if the filter is set on any tier, except "All".
- Fix: Quest Reference list: difficulty headers not dissapearing when the contents are empty.
- Add: Speed Calculator to the Characters (?) section, with explanations. http://www.medianxl.com/t5893-speed-mechanics-explained-updated-speedcalc
- Add: Quest Reference list: K3K necros cast miasma now (add a tooltip that explains what miasma skill is and what it does, like the other skills)
- Add: Quest Reference list: CoV and maybe DP have a proc on being struck - lazorz beam in the opposite(?) direction? Check and add if so. http://www.medianxl.com/t5684p860-short-questions-thread#154303
- All other changes from the XV and XVc changelog.
- (claygame) : do we really need 'armor looks' page?
- Add: a note somewhere (TU/SU/RW/Set... etc.) pages that if you already have a skill that the item gives (from the character), it will only give at max 3 to it.
- Check/update: Are Yshari set items drillable for sockets? Check each of the set items; use as many jewels as the size of the item permits. Add a note under them if they are, and how many sockets.
- Check/Add: Can Ring of Pride be cubed with MOs? What about (More) Luck or Lottery? Can Sigil of the 7 Deadly Sins be cubed for (More) Luck or Lottery recipes?
- Check/Fix: Druid Trap Rat Set: Rainbow Warrior ratfink reanim color gold or magic?
- Check/Fix: Is the Yshari Set Sword item type Mystic Sword? If not, correct it. I also hope all the other Yshari set item names are correct.
- Add/Update: Quest Reference page with various stuff...
- Athulua, Strategy / Abilities section needs updating.
- Add: (CG)- a title for the last 2 check boxes in the quest ref page.



Suggestions:
- (Claygame) Add a pic below every recepie showing what the ingredient look like, for example: minigame recepie have pic of cc and the rune below or beside the recepie text.
- (Claygame) Instead of having "see THIS PAGE for details" below descriptions, make the key part of text as a direct link to the intended page.
- (Claygame) Add pictures of Veteran monster of each act on the monster token page.
- Maybe somehow merge SU/SSU/SSSU and TU6 stuff so it can be more easily compared?
- Maybe add a link to the maps for the ubers that have it? Or add a note at the top of each uber page that the maps are available on Quest Reference page?
- Base items: maybe use regex to remove 0 from req str/dex/lvl?
- Add silver td border to RWs, base items and char orb, like in the rest of the pages?
- Add links to some old/legacy docs to the doc, probably a new page under information. (http://www.medianxl.com/t4038-legacy-docs and the ones on the FTP location of the current docs)
- Add a list of monsters that drop each GR in Yshari. I guess I gotta ask Marco if I can do it.
- (claygame) Add pic of the armor/weapon type at the top of each section of RW page to let people know exactly what works for these RW?
- (claygame) Add the top row showing titles of each coloum for each time a separate section starts for Items->Base
- Change: Rune/RWs: Level --> Required Level?
- Base Items page: Maybe add a note that broken ethereal items cannot gain durability even if they have the 'repair xx durability in yy seconds' mod.
- (claygame) : maybe add link to forum somehow in the About page that opens when docs r opened for the first time to make people come more often on forum?
- (CG) : Add different colored pics for Sacred uniques to be seen when mouse-over them just like for special graphic items. example: parma su is black, ssu is green and sssu is black again.. so maybe parma looks green when mouse over the ssu part?

DONE:
- Pester Marco to explain in more detail about the new Amazon faster cast rate with staves and 2h weapons. Then update the note on the Amazon page if necessary.
-  Add: GS abbreviation
- Fix: - Docs > FAQs > LFAQ (Less FAQ) > *Area Guides (Spoilers)* > maps for Triune and Vizjun are not loading. I get 404 not found, probably just some links missing. (Metalistas) /// Also added extra maps to page
- Fix: Area Effect Attack on mount arreat set should be orange.
- Change: Maybe make the "Uniques" node in the menu not open the TU page on click (make it just a normal book that opens the sub-sections).
- Change: Make clicking on a page_book tree open the tree and page, instead of just the page.
- Fix: Check all files for outdated links to Laz's site: http://modsbylaz.hugelaser.com/ --> http://modsbylaz.vn.cz/
- Fix (Claygame & Quirinus): Any proc rolls over after lvl 63. lvl 66 = 2. Looks like (o)skills cap at lvl 62 (so +65 = +62). Check for all instaces of it and fix on all pages.(CG: checked and corrected TU,SU,Sets,RW,Item Oskills page):
 All is One full set bonus gives "100% Chance to cast level 66 Death of a God when you Die" idk if it casts a lvl 2 or lvl 66 ctc, check and correct it if needed. SSSU Short bow have +65 to OHMAN --> 62, looks like it caps instead of rolls over. SSSU spirit edge proc lvl 66 --> 2. Fixed on their own pages, and on proc/oskill list pages.
- Add: Signet of gold upgrade recipe to the cube page, if the recipe exists. eg. 2 or 3 gold sigs --> greater gold sig? /// Tested with 2,3,4,5 sigs seems like recipe is disabled.
- Check out manafire's rewrites for some of the uberquest tests (they're in a topic in the docs subforum) /// Also updated TA trophied Sleep stats
- Remove: Diablo Clone. (from the page and from the menu) /// Commented him out in summoningubers and index.
- Updated Book of summonning recipe, now cubes with Belial charm rather than Astrogha. Also updated Kabraxis' Soul charm. Trinity proc is now on base charm rather than upgrade.
- Item fixes: eternity runeword gives Enhanced Defence instead of Damage; steel punisher no longer gives Deathlord morph; blackened no longer gives Duriel reanimate; reaper's hand no longer gives queen of blades oskill; periapt of life umo now gives + 100 replenish life; ape set changed from +3 skills to +18 Deathstrike [few other changes to set not documented, request SS]

- Fix: Trang-Oul/Trang&#8217;Oul --> Trang&#8217;Oul. (the first ones used to be correct, but blizz changed their minds...) Use Notepad++ to open up all doc files, then use "Replace All in All Opened Documents".
- Remove: Proc/oskill page: Remove procs from Tier 1-5 (so only TU(6) should remain), to reduce the number of useless lines. /// Commented them out instead, as it is a lot of information in case we change our mind.
- Check/Fix: Block chance formula (Concepts > Block & Defense): (Block% * (Dexterity - 16))/(Character_Level * 2) Check if it's 15 or 16 and if the max block table is correct (by trying ingame). Table 8% = 2266 or 2265? /// Correct constant in formula is 15 (no biggie tho). Adjusted table accordingly.
- Add: WUW abbreviation: what you want (for it), explain that it's used when trading, look at N NN O R abbr.
- Add: Abbreviation/Uberquests: Mendeln to indicate void boss. Change: Abbreviations/Uberquests - separate RS, Rathma - each in its own line. Rathma can mean Rathma from the void or rathma from Rathma Square. RS means Rathma Square uber.
- Fix: FAQ: features -> uber and challenge links are broken.
- (Claygame) Add a desc to tell that cc says "all trials completed" when all trials r done and hearts have not been cubed yet, idk coding so i cant do it.
- Check/Fix: Is the AoE on Mount Arreat set orange or gold or what color is it? /// Text should be in correct colour now
- Update: all character pages with new skills and images
