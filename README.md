===================================

Add to-do stuff here.

TO-DO:
- Suggestion (rishab/Claygame): Add a desc to tell that cc says "all trials completed" when all trials r done and hearts have not been cubed yet, idk coding so i cant do it.
- Suggestion (rishab/Claygame): Add a pic below every recepie showing what the ingredient look like, for example: minigame recepie have pic of cc and the rune below or beside the recepie text.
- Suggestion (rishab/claygame): Instead of having "see THIS PAGE for details" below descriptions, make the key part of text as a direct link to the intended page.
- Suggestion (rishab/claygame): Add pictures of Veteran monster of each act on the monster token page.
