Median XL: Ultimative Documentation

===================================

Add to-do stuff here.

TO-DO (those with no names are added by Quirinus):
- Fix (Claygame & Quirinus): Any proc (and probably skill/oskill? check) rolls over after lvl 63. lvl 66 = 2. Check for all instaces of it and fix on all pages.
- Add: skill tree names to char pages
- Add: WUW abbreviation: what you want (for it), explain that it's used when trading, look at N NN O R abbr.
- Add: oskills from new sets and set items to the oskills list page
- Add: procs from new sets and set items to the procs list page
- Update: any proc/oskill change on any item on the oskills/procs list page
- Update: all character pages (partially done) and skillpoint planner
- Fix: - Docs > FAQs > LFAQ (Less FAQ) > *Area Guides (Spoilers)* > maps for Triune and Vizjun are not loading. I get 404 not found, probably just some links missing. (Metalistas)
- Add: Sin set weapon/shield have special graphic. Check the ss (ask quirinus or someone for it) and find the image on google/wikis or extract from mpq. Then put it in the right folder and apply it to the sets.html page.
- Remove: Diablo Clone. (from the page and from the menu)
- Add: Maybe include the socketed rune bonus in the RW stats (or make it toggleable).
- Add: Shield chance to block on all item pages (base+stat, for class-only add class base chance too).
- Change: Maybe make the "Uniques" node in the menu not open the TU page on click (make it just a normal book that opens the sub-sections).
- Fix: Area Effect Attack on mount arreat set should be orange.
- Fix: Make ([Class] Only) either white or red for all items/classes. Currently only Barbarian items have it as white, the rest have red.(rish: if every other char have it as red.. make barb red too, will be easier and will look sexier. I did it for SU/TU/Sets page. If its fine then u can strike this Fix off this list)
- Change: Prefix/suffix list: Make calculators not reset the filter dropdowns/inputs.
- Change: Rename some of the areas that have changed names (uberquest pages, challenges, quest reference list and anywhere else that it might appear). Change their parent level names too if they're different.
- Change: Make clicking on a page_book tree open the tree and page, instead of just the page.
- Remove: Proc/oskill page: Remove procs from Tier 1-5 (so only TU(6) should remain), to reduce the number of useless lines.
- Change: Make RW page in two columns; put name/level above properties, put rune description below that, and after that are the properties. Or something like that.
- Change: Make filters on all pages always float in vision (absolute pos)?
- Change: TU page: make the amulets/rings/jewels/quivers be in columns of 2 if the filter is set on any tier, except "All".
- Fix: Quest Reference list: difficulty headers not dissapearing when the contents are empty.
- Fix: Check all files for outdated links to Laz's site: http://modsbylaz.hugelaser.com/ --> http://modsbylaz.vn.cz/
- Add: Speed Calculator to the Characters (?) section, with explanations. http://www.medianxl.com/t5893-speed-mechanics-explained-updated-speedcalc
- Add: Quest Reference list: K3K necros cast miasma now (add a tooltip that explains what miasma skill is and what it does, like the other skills)
- Add: Quest Reference list: CoV and maybe DP have a proc on being struck - lazorz beam in the opposite(?) direction? Check and add if so. http://www.medianxl.com/t5684p860-short-questions-thread#154303
- Fix: FAQ: features -> uber and challenge links are broken.
- All other changes from the XV and XVc changelog. 
- (claygame) : do we really need 'armor looks' page?


Suggestions:
- (Claygame) Add a desc to tell that cc says "all trials completed" when all trials r done and hearts have not been cubed yet, idk coding so i cant do it.
- (Claygame) Add a pic below every recepie showing what the ingredient look like, for example: minigame recepie have pic of cc and the rune below or beside the recepie text.
- (Claygame) Instead of having "see THIS PAGE for details" below descriptions, make the key part of text as a direct link to the intended page.
- (Claygame) Add pictures of Veteran monster of each act on the monster token page.
- Maybe somehow merge SU/SSU/SSSU and TU6 stuff so it can be more easily compared?
- Maybe add a link to the maps for the ubers that have it? Or add a note at the top of each uber page that the maps are available on Quest Reference page?
- Base items: maybe use regex to remove 0 from req str/dex/lvl?
- Add silver td border to RWs, base items and char orb, like in the rest of the pages?
- Add links to some old/legacy docs to the doc, probably a new page under information. (http://www.medianxl.com/t4038-legacy-docs and the ones on the FTP location of the current docs)
- Add a list of monsters that drop each GR in Yshari. I guess I gotta ask Marco if I can do it.
- (claygame) Add pic of the armor/weapon type at the top of each section of RW page to let people know exactly what works for these RW?
- (claygame) Add the top row showing titles of each coloum for each time a separate section starts for Items->Base
- 

DONE:
- Pester Marco to explain in more detail about the new Amazon faster cast rate with staves and 2h weapons. Then update the note on the Amazon page if necessary.
-  Add: GS abbreviation
